The most obvious route by experience players is to Rambo the 10,000 coins in the Stronghold of Security.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a level 3 account can easily get dropped by high-level monsters. This makes gold making even more limited as a fresh HCIM without making it extremely tedious.<br /><br />Another popular, yet risky, method used go to the ruins in level ? Wilderness to get a full invetory of steel platelegs to sell to vendors. Unfortunately, gold farmers have locked down this spawn so this method isn’t so viable. These gold farmers are using a similar method as shown in this video.<br /><br />There is one spawn outside the wilderness that can make quick gold thanks to the abundance in Free-to-Play worlds that were added to the game. I am referring to the Iron Mace spawn found the the guard hut in Edgeville.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9uIgSFH89pU/XDGO38h1hKI/AAAAAAAAALM/5t-tnG7baZEe7al_AkaVWgsCXTg_y5hawCEwYBhgL/s1600/Edgeville_map.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="264" data-original-width="265" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9uIgSFH89pU/XDGO38h1hKI/AAAAAAAAALM/5t-tnG7baZEe7al_AkaVWgsCXTg_y5hawCEwYBhgL/s1600/Edgeville_map.png" /></a></div><br /><i>Just a few seconds away from the spawn</i><br /><br />This mace has a very low value on the grand exchange and makes for a horrible training weapon. This is why it is overlooked by normal players. Fortunately for ironmen, this spot has little competition and sells to the nearby General Store for 25 coins.<br /><br />The idea is to fill your inventory with maces and sell one at a time to the General Store while hopping worlds. It is tedious but a full inventory will net 700 coins. Within a few inventories, you should be able to buy most of the starter items that you need as a level 3.<br /><br />Note: This method isn’t really viable for regular accounts. Even collecting bones in Lumbridge would be significantly faster than selling iron maces.<br /><br />With this newly acquired gold, I recommend purchasing an Event RPG and Chronicle from <a href="http://oldschoolrunescape.wikia.com/wiki/Diango">Diango in Draynor Village.</a> For questing food, wines are sold in the same town.
