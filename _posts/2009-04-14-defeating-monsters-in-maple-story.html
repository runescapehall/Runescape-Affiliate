<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090106050401/http://www.maplestoryempire.com/content/guide-monster.php">MS&nbsp;Monsters</a> are the resident bad guys in just about every video game ever made. In  Maple Story, monsters are what you’re sent to destroy on almost every  quest. They’re also available for killing just for fun or to pick up  that item you’ve been looking for. Since they are the main baddies in  the game, there are a wide variety of monsters with different levels and  skills. Nothing says a good time like beating down Griffey.<br /><br />As you start out as a beginner Maple Story character, the monsters  you have to fight are rather weak. When you level up and progress  through the game, you’ll notice the types of monsters you fight are  stronger with better skills than the lower level monsters. The worst  skills they use are the ones you can’t counteract, like raising their  own attack or defense. Some skills will have damaging effects to you and  possibly prevent you from attacking. There are skills like stun and  darkness that will give your character a hard time unless you know how  to counter the effects.<br /><br />Potions are made specifically for countering these monsters’ skills.  Each potion will be labeled for its use. They can be found in shops and  some <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090106050401/http://www.maplestoryempire.com/content/guide-monster.php">Maple Story monsters</a> will even drop them from time to time. If you don’t like using potions,  the effects of the magic will wear off over time. You can then resume  fighting with your weapons and any skills you have. Of course, it might  be hard since they’re so cute.
