This is just how I suggest to organize it. I don't really do it this  way, twist it around to how you like the guide and customize it to  yourself. For free players just remove the members items from your  organization guide :P <br /><br /><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 100%;">Contents</span><br />I.

Introduction (for your amusement)</u></b><br /><br />So  you're sitting in Varrok and you see someone paying 1k each for up to  2,000 cabbage. You happen to know you have 3k cabbage in your bank and  quickly open it. Uh oh! Where is it!? You know you have that cabbage in  here somewhere, better find it quick, 2 mil is at stake! Maybe its in  with your food? Wait...your food is all over the place, you have your  sardines sitting at the bottom, your anchovies around the top and you  run across your pking food (shrimp) somewhere in the middle. Your  cabbage isn't by any of those. You spend 2 minutes hunting around and  finally find it wedged between your bronze medium helm and your raw  chicken. You withdraw 2k cabbage and [choose ending]<br /><br />Ending one: He has already bought them from someone else<br /><br />Ending two: He logged out<br /><br />Ending  three: He tellied and has private chat off. You only have 14 magic and  cannot teleport but you have already been training it up for when you pk  so decided to run over to barbarian village and kill some barbarians  with magic so you can telly around looking for him. You accidentally  attack Gunthor the Brave (Level-29) after attacking a level 7 barbarian.  The barbarian hits 3, gunthor hits 7. You run, the barbarian throws his  axe at you, hits you for 2 more. An evil chicken, swarm, and by some  twist of fate a river troll simultaneously appear. The troll hits you  for 5, the swarm kills you with a 1, and the chicken proceeds to say  "PMG <span style="color: #666666;">ur so surved</span>!!11eleventyone11!1!shiftone1!!1!11"  and breakdances in your face as you die, then invents a slap emote and  uses it on you. You lose your 46 mind runes you spent your entire rs  career earning and ironically, your cabbage which you forgot to bank. I  give you cookies for actually reading this ending.<br />_________________________________<br /><br /><br /><b><u>II. How to organize</u></b><br /><span style="color: #666666;">You do not have to keep the categories in the same order but you should have these general categories.</span><br /><br />1. Money <br />2. Rares/Holiday items<br />3. Random junk items you collect or tools<br />4. Runes <span style="color: #663300;">(ectophial goes next to laws if you want for tellying)</span><br />5. Fishing gear and Food<br />6. Herbs<br />7. Potions<br />8.  Make a list of your favorite skills (noncombat) and put items in order  of most used to least used skills (exclude magic, fletching, range,  herblore, and fishing<br />9. Miscellaneous <br /><span style="color: #333300;">10. Quest items</span><br />11. Bones (optional, I personally bury them or leave them on the ground)<br />12. Jewelry<br /><span style="color: #666666;">14. Carpentry items excluding tools [6/12/06 update]</span><br />13. Random event/useless clothing (not rares) such as mime gear and prince outfit<br />14. Slayer gear<br /><span style="color: #333300;">15. Robes, staffs, and other mage gear<br />16. Fletching materials, bows, arrows</span><br />17. Melee gear (trimmed/decorative first)<br />_____________________________<br /><br /><b><u>III. Alternative methods of organization</u></b><br /><ul><li>Alphabetacal order :P</li><li>Least used to most used</li><li>Think  of your own way, "this is a guide, not a bible" -ben goten78. This is  mainly to give you some concepts that you can adopt to your own liking</li></ul>_____________________________<br /><br /><b><u>IV. Categories of skills items [only a few skills, most should be self explanitory]</u></b><br /><br />Crafting: Moulds, brown <span style="color: #663300;">apron</span>, needle, thread, hides, leather, gems, balls of string (usually followed by mining items)<br /><br />Mining/smithing: Ores, bars, Essence only if you don't use it yourself (otherwise goes before runes)<br /><br />Farming: Seeds, anything you farmed (excluding herbs), scarecrow, farmin<span style="color: #663300;">g</span> tools, sacks, baskets, anything you use to pay for farmers to watch  your crops, pineapples (supercompost, 15 will fill a bin), roots (you  get them after cutting down a tree and then digging it up)<br /><br />Herblore: Vials, un ids, identified herbs, second ingrediants, pestle and mortar, <span style="color: #666666;">potions, beer</span><br />_____________________________<br /><br /><b><u>V. Random tips</u></b><ul><li>Put beer with your potions, even if they help a skill like dwarven stout put it ahead or after potions</li><li>Arrange items within the category from weakest to strongest</li><li>Use  'placeholders', If you withdraw all your money leave 1 gp in there to  hold its place. If you use plan to use all your arrows leave 1 in your  bank so when you get more you don't have to reorganise your bank as much  </li><li>If you can buy more than one of an item so you can use the  spare set as a placeholder (Gives you something to do with your extra  money free players)</li><li>If you need a guide on items to discard use  Myst's guide to bank organisation located here (this game is not the  same topic as mine, despite the same title, Myst's guide is just how to  free up space)<br />&lt;a href="http://www.zybez.net/misc.php?id=35" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.zybez.net/misc.php?id=35&lt;/a&gt;</li><li><span style="color: #663300;">Use the insert button to put in an item with out screwing up the order of everything else</span></li><li><span style="color: #663300;">If  you need more bank space some people make new accounts just to hold  extra items or rares incase their main gets hacked then usually the  bank/safe account won't be unless they log on it alot</span></li></ul>_____________________________
