<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="d"><tbody><tr><th>Length</th><td>Short</td></tr><tr><th>Difficulty</th><td>Easy</td></tr><tr><th>Requirements</th><td>Level 10 fishing</td></tr><tr><th>Suggested items</th><td>Garlic, a spade, and a regular fishing rod.</td></tr><tr><th>Reward</th><td>1 quest point and use of the tunnel that bypasses wolf mountain.</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Start out by talking to one of the dwarves at either end of the dwarf  tunnel (small buildings to the east and west of wolf mountain, they will  tell you they want a golden trophy and you have to win the fishing  contest to get it. they also give you a pass to get into the fishing  contest.<br /><br /> Now go to the fishing arena north of the fishing guild. Talk to Grandpa  Jack and he tells you about the red vine worms that carps like best  (thats what fish you will be catching) to get them go north to  Mc'Grubber's Woods and enter through the loose fence. Use your spade on  the vines on the ground to get some red vine worms (4 or 5 is enough)  then go back down the fishing arena and talk to Morris to enter the  competition.<br /><br /> Go over to the pipes and rub garlic on them. That drives the sinister  stranger away so you can take his spot. Take his spot and get some giant  carp (the only thing you CAN catch) and you will win the competition,  go <br />
