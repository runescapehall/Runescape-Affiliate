The game is <span class="marker-highlight">free  of charge</span>, but you may also become a paid member and get  extra advantages such as more weapons, armors and access to paid  member only areas. <br />&nbsp; <br /><h3>Facts about AWplanet </h3><b>Small software size and low system requirements</b><br /><b><br /></b>You can start playing the game after only a few minutes of downloading  the client, on almost any device (including PDA and mobile phones).<br /><br /><b>Doesn’t require a fast Internet connection</b><br /><b><br /></b>Your computer and the server are constantly exchanging  data to synchronize you client with the AWplanet world, but thanks  to our data compression system you will be able to play AWplanet  with slow internet connection and low traffic.<br /><br /><b>A giant, mystifying world to explore</b><br /><b><br /></b>Islands, continents, settlements, dark underground passages and  unexplored areas will be at your disposal in the world of AWplanet.  It is a really large world full of exciting places to discover!<br /><br /><b>Fighting System</b><br /><br />There is nothing better than hand-to-hand combat with a friend or a sworn  enemy. There are all opportunities for realization of your fighting  instincts. There is also a <span class="marker-highlight">wide variety of weapons  and armors</span> and each has unique attributes along with a choice  of fighting styles. Player VS player battles are allowed only in  special zones, but if you are a civilian, no other players can attack  you.<br /><br /><b> AWplanet NPC's</b><br /><b><br /></b>Besides yourself and other players the world of AWplanet is populated  with both harmless and dangerous inhabitants. From robot-guards  to human shoppers, bankers and other NPC’s (Non Player Characters)  that will help you to develop and master the game.<br /><br /><b>Complex system of character parameters</b><br /><br />With such a wide range of available attributes for  your character such as physical, intellectual, social and professional  characteristics, you are able to create a completely unique character.<br /><br /><b>Friendly and supportive community</b><br /><br />When playing the game, you will easily find someone who is able to help  you with tasks or find other players interested in the same things  as you, so you are able to complete tasks together.<br /><br /><b>Character creation and improvement system</b><br /><br />When you first create your character you will be able to choose  a unique appearance for him/her.

Furthermore,  this means the world of AWplanet is a lot more pleasant to look  at because of the rich detail on the landscapes, buildings, bridges,  roads, fields, trees, flowers, rivers and seas. All this helps to  make your game play experience greatly improved.<br /><br /><b>Realistic items system</b><br /><b><br /></b>The world of AWplanet is now even more realistic because of the detailed  items system. You can pickup everything and drop everything, you  can get information on every item you find, and you are able to  use items such as plants and fish in different ways. For example,  harvest some grain using a sickle, grind it into flour and mix it  with water to create some dough. Next get some chicken meat and  put it in the oven together with the dough, which will create a  kebab that you can eat to regain health. This is a simple process,  but once you achieve higher levels you will be able to use other  technologies and create more superior items. <br /><h3>Players</h3><div class="figure-image" style="float: right; text-align: center;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090502124836/http://www.awplanet.com/rw/resource/world/players.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Players" border="0" height="110" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20090502124836im_/http://www.awplanet.com/rw/resource/world/players.jpg" title="Players" width="150" /></a>  <br /><div class="figure-image-caption" style="text-align: center;">Players </div></div>Most characters you will meet belong to the players, the same as well as  you. This very characters form the AWplanet community.<br /><br />Here you can  make an acquaintance with players from Ukraine, Estonia, China or  Russia, some of them just have started the game and other – have been  playing for several years…<br /><br />To take off possible questions, let us define the difference between the  terms “player” and “character”.  Player is a person who plays the  AWplanet. He or she may create one or several characters; each of them  is a virtual personality gradually developing its skills. Therefore in  this documentation we apply the term “character” concerning parameters  or professional skills, and apply the term “player” concerning game  interaction.<br /><br />Each character has its own set of parameters, which determines its  status, combat strength, professional skills, etc. But information about  the rank of other character is available to you only (a new rank is  given each time when the combat level increases on ten points – to learn  about it read the passage the «<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090502124836/http://www.awplanet.com/rw/pages/docs/development/combat/contents.en.do">Combat level and reputation</a>»).<br /><br />You are free to perform various kinds of co-operations with other  players, such as communication, trade, battles. You may enter one of the  game-clans or create your own clan. The full list of possible  interactions is given in the passage «<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090502124836/http://www.awplanet.com/rw/pages/docs/fundamentals/interface/interface.en.do">Interface and controls</a>».<br /><br />Though the battles between players are permitted, they aren’t welcomed:  attacking a player you gain status of killer (PK) and your reputation  decreases. <br /><br /><br /><h3>Service characters (NPCs) </h3><div class="figure-image" style="float: right; text-align: center;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090502124836/http://www.awplanet.com/rw/resource/world/syscharecters.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Service characters (NPCs)" border="0" height="110" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20090502124836im_/http://www.awplanet.com/rw/resource/world/syscharecters.jpg" title="Service characters (NPCs)" width="150" /></a>  <br /><div class="figure-image-caption" style="text-align: center;"><b>Service characters (NPCs)</b></div></div>Except the players, a great number of different service characters  inhabit the AWplanet world – merchants, bankers, representatives of  authority, farmers, all of them would help you to feel at home in  AWplanet.<br /><br />They are controlled by computer, not by a person and never  leave the game.<br /><br />To use their services, click on them with mouse right  button and select the menu-item “Talk to” and in the further dialog  choose the options that are of interest to you at the moment. Thus,  speaking to a banker you’ll get an access to your personal slot and  speaking to a merchant you’ll open a trade-window. <br /><br />Some NPCs need your help, carrying out their task you may get some reward (more detailed information is given in the passage «<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090502124836/http://www.awplanet.com/rw/pages/docs/development/quests.en.do">Quests</a>»). <br /><br /><h3>Monsters and creatures</h3>The AWplanet world is inhabited by different kinds of creatures. Some of  them would never attack you, but other are aggressive and eager to kill  any player. Here you can meet:  <br /><ul><li>The most real aliens, representatives of zartul-race, who have been inhabiting this planet at all times </li><li>Local creatures unknown to earth dwellers</li><li>Earth animals, which were brought by colonists and assimilated in new habitat </li><li>Criminals, who have eluded the earth laws and found asylum in this secluded corner of galaxy</li><li>Mysterious Black warriors, whose origin is unknown</li><li>War droids, which disobeyed and now oppose the players.</li></ul>You can meet monsters in different areas, but many of them live in their  favorite habitats. Thus, smugglers settled in docks of cosmoport and  zartuls live in their small village. Rats and scorpions occur in  dungeons and flying stropterix-pangolins occur in rocky areas. Many  monsters attack you if you get around them close enough. Animals as  usual are not aggressive, but some of them (e.g. deer) may attack you in  response.<br /><br />You can attack monsters and animals without any harm to your reputation.  As a reward you may get various trophies – e.g. modifier-components and  electronic devices, clothes, meat, skins, etc...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/LW83ThW.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="408" data-original-width="600" height="217" src="https://i.imgur.com/LW83ThW.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br />You can attack monsters and animals without any harm to your reputation.

It depends on the  way you choose – rough warrior or peaceful craftsman, treasure seeker or  vagrant hermit. On the way to the top you have to do a lot and to learn  a lot – different handicrafts, fighting art, money earning, interaction  with other players. <br />All the issues concerning the life and development of your character are  covered in detail in this section. Read it if you wish to study this or  that subject thoroughly. But if you don’t want to lose your time, turn  to section «<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090227160417/http://awplanet.com/rw/pages/docs/fundamentals/firststeps/firststeps.en.do">First steps</a>» – there you will find only the most important information you need for the game. <br /><h2></h2><h2><img height="1" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20090503060941im_/http://www.awplanet.com/images/awplanet/spacer.gif" width="24" />                  </h2><h2>                                                                       Character stats</h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2>In the game AWplanet your character develops together with you. As in  other role-playing games the character has a number of parameters  corresponding to different physical, intellectual and spiritual  characteristics of a human being. While performing different actions in  game the meanings of the character’s parameters change as well. <br /><h3></h3><br /><h2>                                                                       Items</h2><div id="printReady">To make the AWplanet world really plausible we elaborated a detailed  scheme of working with items. There are several hundred types of items  in the game and they can be used in the most different ways.<br /><br />Some items  are materials that are used for production of the more complex things,  other – allow to modify character-parameters, another, such as armour  and weapons, extend its combat strength. Besides, in the semi-feudal  AWplanet world items as well as gold serve as symbol of prosperity and  are used in barter trade.  <br /><br /><h3>Item categories</h3>Here is the description of items you’ll have to deal with in the game: <br /><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="specs"> <tbody><tr>   <th>Category     </th><th>Examples</th><th>Description</th>  </tr><tr class="table-odd">   <td>Resources and materials    </td>   <td>Ores, crystals, meat, wheat     </td>   <td>You can obtain the most different natural resources. They may be sold or used in production of more complex items.    </td>  </tr><tr class="table-even">   <td>Tools and equipment    </td>   <td>Pick, fishing net, blacksmith’s press    </td>   <td>Tools are used to boot the resources, to treat and output the items.  The stationary equipment (blast-furnaces, blacksmith’s forges) is used  to manufacture the things.    </td>  </tr><tr class="table-odd">   <td>Weapons and armour    </td>   <td>Helmet, greaves, shield, sword, gun    </td>   <td>These items extend the defence and fighting damage.     </td>  </tr><tr class="table-even">   <td>Clothes    </td>   <td>Cloak, boots, shirt    </td>   <td>Allows changing the appearance of character.    </td>  </tr><tr class="table-odd">   <td>Food    </td>   <td>Bread, kebab, cheburek    </td>   <td>Restore the character’s health    </td>  </tr><tr class="table-even">   <td>Money    </td>   <td></td>   <td>Are used in trade. Monetary unit – credits.    </td>  </tr><tr class="table-odd">   <td>Items changing character-parameters    </td>   <td>Modifiers, drinks, healing potions    </td>   <td>Allow to change character-parameters temporarily or restore the health-level, vitality, force-energy.    </td>  </tr><tr class="table-even">   <td>Other items    </td>   <td>Teleports, books, cups, plates, ammunition    </td>   <td>There are also a great number of different items.    </td>  </tr></tbody></table><br /><h3>Cooperation with items</h3><b>Which items you may use? </b> <br />An intense practice is a key to your character-development. That who  works more would improve his parameters and professional skills sooner!<br /><br />Restrictions on usage of tools and manufacture of various items are also  connected with this. At the beginning you may use simple tools only and  to produce (or obtain) the items (or resources) of a least value. But  with the development of professional skills this situation will change:  you’ll be able to use tools of high-performance and to manufacture  costly things.<br /><br />Moreover, complex electronic devices (e.g. teleport) and science  intensive professional skills (e.g. physics, chemistry, biology) require  sufficiently high level of intellect. To learn more about all these  restrictions read the passage «<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090228013234/http://awplanet.com/rw/pages/docs/development/skills/contents.en.do">Professional skills</a>» or look at the item-information in the game.<br /><br />Mind that some items and skills are available to members only. To learn more read the passage «<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090228013234/http://awplanet.com/rw/pages/docs/payment/contents.ru.do">Payment</a>».<br /><br /><b>Item-information</b> <br />You may examine properties of any item by clicking on it with mouse  right button and selecting the «Information» option in a brought up  menu. There you may learn the following information: <br /><ul><li>skills and parameters required to use an item</li><li>modes of item usage</li><li>an effect from wearing and usage</li><li>weight</li><li>cost</li></ul><blockquote><b>Besides</b> <br />The cost stated there is equal to the purchasing price in stores. The  real market-value when trading with other players may result quite  different.  </blockquote><div class="figure-image" style="float: right; text-align: center;"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090228013234/http://awplanet.com/rw/resource/world/inventory.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Your inventory" border="0" height="110" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20090228013234im_/http://awplanet.com/rw/resource/world/inventory.jpg" title="Your inventory" width="150" /></a><br /><div class="figure-image-caption" style="text-align: center;">Your inventory </div></div><b>Your inventory&nbsp;</b><br /><b>&nbsp;</b>  <br />To take an item click on it with mouse left button and it will appear in  your inventory-list. You can view this list by pressing the key F4. The  amount of items you can carry is determined by the bulk of bag (24  slots) and your carrying capacity. At that, some small items (e.g.  sticks or feathers) can be placed into the same slot.<br /><br />To dress your character drag an armour or clothes to the slots  corresponding to the parts of body or just click on them with mouse left  button.<br /><br /><b>Item-usage</b><br /><b>&nbsp;</b> <br />To use an item click on it with mouse right button and select the «Use»  option in a brought up menu. To use an item together with another item  or equipment (e.g. to roast shrimps in microwave oven) select option  «Use with…» and click on another item or equipment.<br /><br />To use tools (e.g. pick, axe, sickle, fishing net) at first you’ll have  to take them in hands, for that, drag them to the slot corresponding to  the character’s hands in the window of inventory. Then click on the  resource you want to work out. E.g. after taking a pick in hands, click  on the tin-deposit.<br /><br /><b>Item-resource restoration</b><br /><b>&nbsp;</b> <br />It is impossible to restore the resource of the most spent things.  That’s why the only thing you can do about them is to give to the  beginners or throw away. But this doesn’t refer to the cold steel  (swords, daggers), automatic weapons and some electronic devices.<br /><br />Players possessing the high level of «Creation and treatment of items»  skill can sharpen cold steels by means of diamond covering, which would  not only restore weapon durability but also increase it on 10% (the  damage caused would increase too). This operation is to be performed  once only. Mind that to use a covered weapon you’ll have to possess a  higher combat level, to learn more read the passage «<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090228013234/http://awplanet.com/rw/pages/docs/development/combat/contents.en.do">Combat level and reputation</a>».<br /><br />The resource of automatic weapon may be restored by loading of new  ammunition. And some electronic devices (e.g. teleport) may be charged  with the help of battery.<br /><br /><img height="1" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20090502103108im_/http://www.awplanet.com/images/awplanet/spacer.gif" width="24" />                  <br /><h2>                                                                       Combat                                 </h2><br />&nbsp;<img alt=" " border="0" height="157" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20090502103108im_/http://www.awplanet.com/rw/resource/development/promo_fighting.jpg" width="490" />                          <br />Longing to test your spirit and might of muscles? Fight and prove your  toughness to the bleak and cruel world of AWplanet. Success in battles  depends upon nearly each parameter of your character, therefore combat  is the fairest test of your progress in the game.<br /><br />The AWplanet world offers all kinds of opportunities to bring about your  fighting potential. There are wide selection of weapons, the most  various armour and choice of different fighting styles. But if you are  the beginner – nothing threatens you: free battles are permitted in  special combat zones only.<br /><br />Let us examine which characters need to polish up the martial art most of all.  <br /><br /></div>
