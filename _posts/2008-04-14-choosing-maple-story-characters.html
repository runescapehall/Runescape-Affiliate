Like most other MMOs, there are a wide variety of&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090106061428/http://www.maplestoryempire.com/content/maple_story_character.php">MS characters</a> to choose from. The type of character you choose will be integral to  the way you play the game, so you should choose the character you want  carefully – remember you’ll be playing that character for over one  hundred levels.<br /><br />  Each character class in MS branches out into a new character class at  certain levels. When you start the game, you start out as a beginner.  Once you’ve trained in the sort of skills you want to use, you become  one of five different types of Maple Story characters: a swordman, a  magician, an archer, a rogue, or a pirate. From there, each of these  classes branches out into different territory.<br /><br />For example, the  swordman, can become either a fighter, page, or spearman at level 30,  while the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090106061428/http://www.maplestoryempire.com/content/guide-magician.php">Maple Story magician</a> can branch out in to different types of magic spells. Once you choose  your first branch, you’re basically locked into that mode of progression  for the rest of the game.<br /><br />  Once you reach level 70, and then again when you reach level 120,  you’ll change jobs again and become a more advanced version of your  class. For example, if a Swordman chose to become a page at level 30,  he’ll become a White Knight at level 70. Once he finally hits level 120,  he’ll become a Paladin, the final level of advancement for the class.  Once at that level, he’ll be able to do battle with the toughest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090106061428/http://www.maplestoryempire.com/content/guide-monster.php">Maple Story monsters</a> and come out on top.
