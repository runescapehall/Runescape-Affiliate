Well, well, well... If you've decided to make a pure ranger you have  come to the right place. In this little guide i will tell you how to get  the levels fast. F2P and P2P. Now the first thing you want to do is  pick a cool name. I like Teh Needler because Needler sounds like  shooting needles at something. No, I didn't get my name from Halo. Ok  I’m going to cover the needs in a list. Here they are:<br /><ul><li>A good RS id</li><li>All of your basic leather items.</li><li>Studded Legs</li><li>All of the F2P bows</li><li>About 15k Arrows</li><li>and last but not least patience.</li></ul>See  you want to go ahead and locate all of your materials before, that way  you can train and go about leveling faster. Once you have all of this,  go to the next section.<br /><br /><div align="center"><b><u><span style="color: #009900;">ID Idea's</span></u></b></div><br />Someone  tipped me off on including a few idea's on making an ID. Here are a few  choices and tricks you can do to make an account.<br /><br />So you want to  start off with a base name. I chose the word Needler because it is  unique. Here are some different ways you could do the ID.<br /><br />Needler<br />The Needler<br />The  Needler<br />Teh Needler<br />Teh  Needler<br />0 Needler 0<br />o Needler o<br />0 Needler o<br />o Needler 0<br />Ze Needler<br />Ze  Needler<br />Tha Needler<br />Tha  Needler<br />I Needler I<br />Xx Needler Xx<br /><br />I  do not suggest doing an ID like this: o0 0o o0 0o0 o0. In some cases a  few of my friends had to choose a new ID name because it was confusing  to other players. Don’t do this because it is very annoying for  everyone. If someone is a Noob and wants to look you up then that’s  their problem. Keep RuneScape o0o0o0o0 free.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><b><u><span style="color: #009900;">Ranging Levels 1-20</span></u></b></div><br /><br />Ok  so you’re all set and have everything you need. Grab about 350-500  arrows (preferable iron or steel) and head down to the cows. The best  place to find cows are south of Falador and north of Lumbridge. Well you  might need to bring a couple pieces of food if you’re scared but if you  know how to range then you don’t need it. Remember to always train on  rapid too because that is the fastest ranged style and the source for  the best exp. Defensive ranged style is a big NO! I can’t emphasize this  enough. It halves your ranged exp and gives it to defense. Cows are  about 32 exp each and Cow Calves are about 24 exp each. I suggest only  killing cows because we are on a schedule here. You need 4470 exp for 20  Ranged.<br /><br />4470/32=139.6875<br /><br />So about 140 cows will get you  to 20 Ranged. Believe it or not, but I suggest a crowded world because  from what I’ve heard the re-spawn rate is faster but there are less  people training. Here are some important things you need to know from  this section:<br /><ul><li>Lumbridge or Falador</li><li>4470 exp</li><li>140 cows</li><li>350-500 arrows</li><li>Rapid style</li></ul><b>MONEYMAKING TECHNIQUE-</b> Well if you are a little short on cash and you cant afford to buy all  of those arrows I have a solution for you here. Now this will slow your  training down a little bit but it provides some pretty good cash.  Cowhides! Yes, cowhides... Cowhides sell for 100 gp ea that’s 16 or 17  bronze arrows according to my math if you buy for 6gp ea. I didn’t need  to do this but you can if it is necessary.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><b><u><span style="color: #009900;">Ranging Levels 20-40</span></u></b></div><br /><br />Well  after killing all of those cows and getting your studded legs and  willow short bow. You have two choices: Barbarian Village or Varrock  Sewers. Now personally I got to about 24 ranged and got bored at  Barbarian Village. So I went down to the Varrock sewers. I heard that  skeletons and zombies were good exp for the lower levels, so I wanted to  check them out. I went down there and found out that they were really  fast exp. I trained here until 40 ranged. To get 40 Ranged you need  37224 exp. These skeletons are about 96 exp each. So here is the math  for how many skeletons you will need to kill:<br /><br />37224-4470=32754<br />32754/96=341.1875<br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="IPB Image" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20061030114409im_/http://img464.imageshack.us/img464/3359/556at.png" /></div><br /><br />We  will just call this about 345 skeletons. The beautiful thing about this  area is that there is an iron fence that you can shoot through so we  rangers don’t get our armor dirty. This time I suggest a world with  around 1200-1400 people because this place is pretty famous. Important  things to know:<br /><ul><li>Bring 500-600 arrows</li><li>Arrows - Iron or better</li><li>Bring about half inv. of food</li><li>Stand behind fence</li><li>Rapid Style</li></ul><b>MONEYMAKING TECHNIQUE-</b> There aren't really any effective moneymaking techniques here. I  suggest you pick up the runes and coins that they drop if you are  desperate. They drop chaos fairly often and in about an hour I got 30 or  so of them.<br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><b><u><span style="color: #009900;">Ranging Levels 40-50</span></u></b></div><br /><br />Well  this was a little difficult to train because nothing really gives very  fast exp. I know Skeletons are more exp but not necessarily the best to  train on. I headed down to the Edgeville guards. These Guards are good  to train on because there are four of them and they re-spawn fairly  quickly. This area is famous because of the Iron Gate in the little jail  house next to it. You can close the gate and just ranged the guards  until 50 ranged. To get 50 ranged you will need 101333 exp. Assuming you  have around 37200 exp we will do the math.<br /><br />101333-37200=64133 exp.<br />64133/88=728.7840909 or 729<br /><br />You  will need to kill around 730 guards to get 50 ranged. This sounds like a  lot but it really isn’t. I suggest killing around 150-200 and go  PK’ing. There are not many key terms to this section but here they are:<br /><ul><li>Bring iron or better arrows</li><li>15+ Trout or better</li><li>Range behind the gate</li><li>Pk every now and then to ward off boredom</li></ul><b>MONEYMAKING TECHNIQUE-</b>The  guards drop coins fairly often but you wont make much off of them. One  of the only ways possible to make any money is to collect the bones that  they drop and bank them. You will collect anywhere from 700-750 in my  guide. If you sell them 10-15 a piece you might make a little cash.<br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><b><u><span style="color: red;">This is where I got a membership...</span></u></b></div><br /><br /><div align="center"><b><u><span style="color: #009900;">Ranging Levels 50-60</span></u></b></div><br /><br />This  is super easy to train! Bad news though.... feels like forever! Well Im  going to say the members version first. Once you have legally bought  your own membership <img alt="ph34r.gif" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20061030114409im_/http://www.runescapecommunity.com/style_emoticons/default/ph34r.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" />...  Head up to Rellekka. We are finally at the rock crabs. These crabby  little things give 200 exp ea. Isn’t it wonderful? Well you have around  101k exp and for 60 ranged you need 273k exp. So 172k exp for 60 ranged.  Once again, here is the math:<br /><br />273742-101333=172409<br />172409/200=862.045<br /><br />So  go ahead and kill about 865 crabs. It helps if you have a mage bow and  blue dragon hide. I do not ever suggest using a cannon. You don’t want  to have 70 ranged and 40 hit points... Once again not a whole lot of  special information you should know. Here’s a list of some stuff:<br /><ul><li>Don’t get tricked into attacking cave crawlers (they are poison)</li><li>Bring about 1.5k arrows every time you leave for them</li><li>Bring 10-15 lobbies. (They hit a 1 often with 1 defense)</li><li>Bring Camelot teleport if you have 45+ mage.</li></ul><b>MONEYMAKING TECHNIQUE-</b>Not  really any good ways to make money here. They drop level one clues  which are kind of a waste of time and they drop half keys rarely.<br /><br /><br />For  you F2P'ers head back down to the Varrock sewers. You can range Moss  Giants for some pretty good exp here. I’m not going in to much detail  here because as soon as i got 50 ranged i got members. Collect the big  bones they drop and sell for 300-350 gp ea. This provides good cash if  you have a lot of them.<br /><br /><div align="center"><b><u><span style="color: #009900;">Ranging Levels 60-70</span></u></b></div><br /><br />Alright...  This is where the training gets tough. You're so close to your goal.  Only 10 levels off from being able to "0wnz0rz t3h p33ps 1n t3h w1ldy!"  Ok enough small talk. This will require a lot of your time and i do not  suggest going anywhere except for the bank to get food in this next  step. Go start the waterfall quest and get Glarials Amulet. You can  finish the quest and it will get you to like 30 attack and strength if I  am not mistaken. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061030114409/http://www.zybez.net/quests.php?id=74" target="_blank">Here</a> is a guide on the quest. Bring 24 lobsters or sharks and at least 1000  steel or better arrows. Iron knives work well here also. Grab your rope  and best ranged gear. (I do not suggest bringing a Robin or rangers  unless you aren't scared of losing them.) Go to the waterfall and climb  on the raft. Use your rope with the rock. Then, use your rope with the  dead tree. I do not think it is required to wear the amulet but I always  do because I am paranoid  <img alt="ph34r.gif" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20061030114409im_/http://www.runescapecommunity.com/style_emoticons/default/ph34r.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" />.  Go into the dungeon and RUN north because there are lvl 57 Shadow  Spiders there. There are two spots to range here. The entrance wall and  the table. You can across the table after a few minutes and they become  un-aggressive. I will need to take a picture of the other spot because  it is difficult to explain. You can range the closest spawn to the  doors. He will get stuck along the wall and you will be perfectly safe.  Here's the math for this section:<br /><br />737627-273742=463885<br />463885/444=1044.786036<br /><br />Also here is a good way to range without being hit:<br /><div align="center"><img alt="IPB Image" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20061030114409im_/http://img358.imageshack.us/img358/2394/firestechnique3qv.png" /></div><br /><br /><br />Fire  giants are round 444 exp I think and you will need to kill about 1045  of them. ALWAYS pick up the fire runes. Don’t be surprised if you go to  bank and you have 5k of them. 5k of fire runes is 100k gp. Important  factors:<br /><ul><li>24 Lobbies or Shark</li><li>1000+ Steel or better arrows</li><li>Glarials Amulet</li><li>60+ Ranged</li><li>And a Rope</li></ul><b>MONEYMAKING TECHNIQUE-</b>This  is one of the best places in the world for money in my opinion. These  guys drop uncut dragon stones, rune scimitars, rune kite shields, dragon  medium helmets, dragon left halves, uncut gems, TONS of fire runes,  herbs, coins, rune arrows, and rune javelins. (All I can remember off  the top of my head.  <img alt="XD.gif" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20061030114409im_/http://www.runescapecommunity.com/style_emoticons/default/XD.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" /> )<br /><br /><div align="center"><b><u><span style="color: #009900;">Ranging Levels 70+</span></u></b></div><br /><br />I  suggest staying at the fire giants for a very long time. We are talking  to about 85-90 ranged. You cant beat the money and exp. They aren’t in a  multi zone so people can’t use those annoying cannons on your giants or  team up on your giant. If you are having trouble getting giants because  higher levels are taking them there's a little trick I have found. I  bring 200 air runes and 200 mind runes sometimes. Just Wind Strike them  and you can right click them. <br /><br />For free to players (F2P'ers) I  suggest going either to moss giants or lesser demons. I prefer lessers  because they are more exp and you can get a Rune Med drop every now and  then. You can go to the Volcano on karamja. There is a spawn of about 6  lesser's there I think.<br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><b><u><span style="color: #009900;">Ranging Levels 80+</span></u></b></div><br />Now  some people may get bored at fire giant and want to train somewhere  else. I've come up with two solutions which can both be found in the  same area. Go down to taverly dungeon and get to the blue dragons (dont  forget your dusty key) and go until you see a tunnel. In that tunnel  there are: hellhounds, black demons, and black dragons. (Im not really  sure how strong black dragons are.) I havn't really been here but most  of my freinds with 90+ ranged say that they are all great for exp.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><b><u><span style="color: #009900;">Becoming The Best Ranger You Can Be</span></u></b></div><br /><br />The  long awaited new section of the guide is finally here!! Once you have  gotten 70 ranged, a whole new window of ranged equipment becoomes  available. I will list in this section how to obtain and effectively use  these items. (This section of the guide will also include pking  tips...)<br /><br /><div align="center"><b><u><span style="color: #009900;">Pure Section</span></u></b></div><br /><br />Okay,  now many of you pure rangers get to 70 ranged and think, "I wasted all  my time on this skill." But that isn't true. You have "unlocked" two  very powerful bows, one in which requires a quest to obtian, and the  other you can just buy.<br /><br />You have the choice between: Karils Crossbow, Magic Shortbow, or the almighty Crystal Bow.<br /><br />You  have had the magic shortbow since lvl 50. It is very powerful and  inexpensive, but some people like to spice it up a little and use  sopmething a little more powerful.<br /><br />Karil's Crossbow (also  referred to as an x-bow) can hit a max of about 18 at 70 ranged. They  may have changed it by now but that what it hit in my pure ranging day.  This bow is slower than a magic shortbow, but nontheless more powerful.  May I also include that this weapon has its own set of ammo known as  Bolt Racks. Bolt Racks sell for about 300 gp ea and they are a one shot  only ordeal, in other words you shoot them once like a spell and you  cant pick them up.<br /><br />The Crystal Bow is the most powerful bow in  the game. At 91 ranged you can hit 21's fairly often, and it DOESN'T  REQUIRE AMMO!! Bad news.. It has weapon stamina like the barrows armor.  At 10/10 i tihnk its a +100 ranged bonus (not sure on this), and when it  reaches 0/10 you must go get it recharged for 900k. But dont wory. It  drops in price to recharge every time you recharge it. Eventually it  drops to 180k a charge. It does not go below 180k a charge though. A  fully charged crystal bow has 2500 shots.
