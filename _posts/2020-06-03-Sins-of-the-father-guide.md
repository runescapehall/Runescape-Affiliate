This is the latest, and perhaps the last installment in the Vampyre quest line. It overlaps with the Runescape 3 version, The Branches of Darkmeyer, although there are some great differences between the two.

## Quest Requirements

You will need to have the previous vampire quest line completed, which includes:
- A Taste of Hope
- Vampyre Slayer

You will also need these skill before being allowed to start it: 
- 62 Woodcutting
- 60 Fletching
- 56 Crafting
- 52 Agility
- 50 Attack
- 50 Slayer
- 49 Magic 

## Benefits from completing Sins of the Father:
- Daeyalt Essence – This ore had existed in the quest line without having a use. It is now used in an AFK runecrafting method that supposedly beats others in the game.
- Improved Ivandis Flail – The Ivandis Flail is the only item in the game that can defeat vyrewatch, and it amplifies your damage & accuracy. The improved version will have higher strength, and thus it is faster to kill any vampire in the game.
- Darkmeyer City – It is a full city with all of the venue, including a clothing shop and altar next to the bank. There are some interesting things to see, including the castle, but we won’t give too many spoilers. This city contains improved vyrewatch, which drops the new Blood Shard, along with other impressive loot.
- Blood Shards – The blood shard is similar to what was released in Runescape 3 and can be combined with an amulet of fury. It has a chance to heal 10% of the damage you deal, and once all 10,000 charges are used, your amulet of fury will revery back to normal.
- Vyrelords – You’ve seen them run around the Theatre of Blood, but the city of Darkmeyer has slightly different vyrelored and ladies. At 82 Thieving, they may be pickpocketed for various luxury items, including Blood Shards.
- Vyrewatch Sentinels – These are aggressive vampires found in the city that can make for a decent training method. They have a very rare chance at dropping the new shard.
- Hallowed Sepulchre – A crypt in the corner of the city that contains various traps and treasures. Some have compared it to Pyramid Plunder, but it’s more complex.

## Starting Out

Go to the church in Slepe and speak to Veliaf Hurtz, a familiar face from the quest line. He will give you an explanation about the Sleeper Plague, which people cannot wake up from their deep sleep. This may overlap with the Nightmare Boss update.

Hameln the Jester (who is in the purple outfit) is right inside the same church, so continue to talk to him. He gives you the hint that his partner got sick after a drink in the pub, so move onto the next clue in the bar.

**Carl** is the bartender with apron. Talk to him about the beer that made Hameln’s friend sick, and choose options about where the beer comes from.

There is a barrel behind the bar that will trigger a cut scene upon examining it. You will accompany carl on the way to the town’s dungeon, and you have to avoid being seen, similar to other quests like Witch’s House where you need to take cover when necessary.

Once you reach the end of this sequence, the tables have turne and Carl will become aggressive towards you. He attacks with magic and melee, and you will have to dodge the vials that he throws to avoid having your stats reduced. Overall, it’s not a hard fight.

After defeating him, **destroy the nearby table.**

Return to Veliaf in the Slepe Church Graveyard. 
Head to Drezel at the Paterdomus
