Phoenix member: Talk to  Straven about the master thieves armband, he tells you to get it you  must steal Pete's candlestick from the black arm gang, he also tells you  of an associate in Brimhaven where Pete's house is, and the password:  gherkin.Grab a bow and some arrows and head to Karamja, get the key from  your black arm friend (explained in black arm part) and talk to the  bartender, be sure to mention the password, and go into the kitchen, the  cook will tell you of a secret panel, push it and go through the yard  into the other building and use the key on the door to the small room.  Now range gherkin and go get the candlestick from your friend.Then talk  to Straven again and get your armbandBlack Arm: talk to your leader and  she will tell you that to get your armband you will have to steal scar  face Pete's armband, she will also give you I. D. papers.<br /><br />Now grab full  black (large, plate, and legs) and head to Brimhaven. Go into Scarface  Pete's mansion where you will be stopped, show your I.D. papers and you  will be allowed to pass and given a key, give this to your Phoenix gang  friend. Now have your friend range the guard named Grip, he will drop  some keys, use these keys to get into the treasure room where you will  find the candlesticks. Give one to your friend and take one back to your  leader to get the armband.<br /><br />  Now for the fire feather, to pick up the feather u must get ice gloves  from the ice queen. (bring a pickaxe when getting this) Go to the wolf  mountain and normally where you would go south to Catherby go north and  walk along between the cliffs until you see the rock slide, use your  pickaxe with it to get through. now go around north past the ice  warriors until u get to 3 ladders, take the one farthest north, walk  through the dungeon past the ice warriors and up the ladder. You will be  now on top of another plateau with ice giants, and 3 more ladders,  again take the ladder that is farthest north, then go through the  dungeon until u get to a ladder up. Go down the only ladder on the  plateau you find yourself on. You will now be in the ice queen's throne  room (ice queen is level 103. Once you kill the ice queen she will drop  the ice gloves, take these to Entrana and kill the firebird (in the  north forest area) it will drop a fire feather, pick it up (you **MUST**  be wearing the ice gloves to be able to pick up the feather).<br /><br />  Now for the cooked eel. Talk to the owner of the fish shop in port Sarim  and ask about the fire eel, he will give you some snail slime to put in  a potion.Put some harralandar in a filled vial and add the slime to the  vial to make the oil you need (this takes 25 herblaw) then use the oil  with a REGULAR FISHING ROD to make an oily fishing rod. Now grab an  anti-dragon shield (you can get from duke of Lumbridge even if u did  drag. quest), your oily fishing rod, and some fishing bait and head to  the huge members dungeon south of Tavelry. Make your way through the  dungeon until you get to the lava-pits.<br /><br />Go north past the bridge to the  black knight area, kill a jailor to get jail keys and use them to get  into the jail cell with the man in it, talk to the man and he will give  you a dusty key. Now head back up to the lava pits, over both bridges  past the demons and use the dusty key on the door to the blue dragon  room. Go past the blue dragons until you get where the black demons  respawn. Near here you will find a fishing area, fish with your oily  fishing rod until you get an eel (more than one would be good, but i  have a feeling you cant burn them). Now go back to the surface and cook  the eel.<br /><br />Finally once you have all 3 ingredients: armband, feather,  cooked eel. Talk again to the girl outside the hero guild to get your  reward.
