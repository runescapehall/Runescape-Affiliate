Getting use to this is pretty hard and the stakes are high. I stumbled across this after I was selling blue dragon hides, green dragonhides, and black dragonhides. I made green hides 2k each, blue 3k each, and black 5k each. I went on the forums and posted those prices. One person corrected me. He said greens were 1k, blues 2k, blacks 3k, and reds 5k. I have never realized they were this much. So I tried to make it possible for myself. I had a high range so it was an advantage. I didn't want to go to the wilderness so I tried Brimhaven dungeon. It was hard the first trip but i got used to it. Then I started doing it more and more and then I was rich. I now have an abyssal whip and have full Torag armor currently. The technique is quite simple. This guide will teach you how.<br /><br />IV.) The Red Dragon Itself<br /><br />There are two locations. One, is in the wilderness, and one is in Brimhaven dungeon. Go with the one in Brimhaven dungeon which is located on Karajma island, below.<br /><br />IPB Image<br /><br />Then you here is a map of the dungeon below.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060519004948im_/http://img486.imageshack.us/img486/6047/rd20hz.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" data-original-height="375" data-original-width="596" height="126" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20060519004948im_/http://img486.imageshack.us/img486/6047/rd20hz.jpg" width="200" /></a><br /><br />Here is what they look like obviously.<br /><br />IPB Image<br /><br />These guys have a high defense. I wouldn't reccomend anyone to melee them. They do however, have low range and magic defense. I strongly reccomend the following:<br /><br />OVERALL REQUIREMENT<br />27+ Woodcutting<br />34+ Agility<br /><br />RECCOMENDATIONS<br /><br />Ranger<br /><br />70+ Range<br />60+ Defense<br />60+ Strength<br />Range Armor (Karil's or Blackdragonhide)<br />4k arrows (iron, steel, or mithril)<br />Magic Short Bow (or Crystal Bow)<br />Anti-Dragon Breath Shield<br /><br />Mage<br />55+ Magic<br />60+ Defense<br />60+ Strength<br />About 4k-5k Fire bolt spells<br />Chaos gaunlets<br />Mage armor (Splitbark, Mystic Robes, Ahrims)<br />Fire Battlestaff or Lava Staff<br />Anti-Dragon Breath Shield<br /><br /><br />V.) Preparing for Combat<br /><br />First of all, choose a good world with low detailed version. It will help you alot.<br /><br />IPB Image<br /><br /><br />There are several things you need to remember to do this. You need to have a low inventory count. Keep food to a minimum (i take 5 personally). You also need:<br /><br />905 coins (30 coins for ship, 875 for dungeon)<br />Ring of Dueling<br />Axe<br />Weapon (optional)<br />Anti Dragonbreath shield<br /><br />Picture Shown below:<br /><br />IPB Image<br />IPB Image<br /><br /><br />It is also a good idea to keep your lobbies at the bottom of your inventory so your items are organized.<br /><br />Also, note. Rangers can carry 26 hides per trip, mages can carry 24, plan ahead! Plan to eat all your food. In the next section I will explain how this is possible.<br /><br />Tip: There is also another way. You can use take a weapon with you but you have to bring a dropable axe such as bronze.<br /><br />IPB Image<br /><br />VI.) Actual Combat<br /><br />Now this is the where you actually get the hides. Run along through the agility courses and then you should end up at these rocks. The picture below is your range radius:<br /><br />IPB Image<br /><br />When you get there you will be attacked by several Wild Dogs. Use your hatchet or weapon to fight them off.<br /><br />IPB Image<br />IPB Image<br /><br />Just kill at least 8 of them and they'll leave you alone. Until you are waiting for auto attack to be off, here is a safe angle for you to mage/range.<br /><br />IPB Image<br /><br />After auto attack is off, here are several spots then you can mage/range.<br /><br />NOTE!!!! Do NOT go outta of those particular squares. You will be attacked and barbecued!<br /><br />IPB Image<br />IPB Image<br />IPB Image<br /><br /><br />After you get 26 (rangers) or 24 (mages) you will need to get out. This is where the ring of dueling comes into place.<br /><br /><br />For rangers<br /><br />1. You wear your hachet (or weapon) and your anti-dragon breath shield.<br />2. Go then to your equipment and then take off your dueling ring.<br />3. Teleport to Castle Wars and deposit your hides.<br /><br />IPB Image<br />IPB Image<br />IPB Image<br />IPB Image<br /><br />VII.) Conclusion<br /><br />In all it turns out great rewards. You obviously sell them for 5k each after that and make huge profits. I suggest ending your adventure with either 100 hides, 300 hides, or 600 hides. It is great and all. You get tons of experience and in all, your happy. It is limited though. It takes me on an average of 45-60 mins. I suggest you read or do something else while doing this. It can get long and boring. I play pool to past the time.<br /><br />i.) Tips and Tricks<br /><br />Ok so here are the following results you could have.<br /><br />100 hides= 500k<br />300 hides= 1.5 mill<br />600 hides= 3 mill<br /><br />Here is a tip. If you have a crafting level of 77, you can do more with these hides. You can do:<br /><br />600 hides= 100 Dragon armor sets = 40k each = 4 mill!<br />300 hides= 50 Dragon armor sets= 40k each = 2 mill!<br /><br />You can make 500k-1 mill profit with this. Although it might take a while to sell, it's worth it.
