If you really want to do well in this game,&nbsp;then you must learn a thing or two about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120163427/http://www.maplestoryempire.com/guide/mesos.php">Maple Story mesos</a>.  To put it simply, you cannot get anything done in the game unless you  have these valuable commodities. So what is it about MS mesos that makes  them so important? Similar to gold in other games or money in real  life, you are just left out to dry unless you have them at your  disposal.<br /><br /><b>Having them in your pocket will give you the power to make  moves in the game.</b><br /><br />  What happens when you find yourself out of MS mesos while playing the  game? As many players have found out, you just cannot do anything. You  can’t go up against other players and take them down and you can’t even  protect yourself. The problem with this is that you will find it very  difficult to get your hands on Maple Story&nbsp;mesos in some situations.  They are not just laying around, so it takes some real effort to stock  up on them.<br /><br />  Mesos are so important that more and more people are starting to use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081120163427/http://www.maplestoryempire.com/download/money-cheat.php">Maple Story money cheats</a> which means that&nbsp;in the end, they will have more mesos than anybody  else who is playing the game. This should show you how key these things  are to your survival in Maple Story, so if you are serious about MS  mesos, then you should definitely do what it takes.
