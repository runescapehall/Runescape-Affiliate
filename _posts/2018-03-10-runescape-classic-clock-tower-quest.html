To do this you must  retrive 4 colored cogs and placeing them in there proper place. After  starting the quest go down the ladder near by. Each time you retive a  cog you must place it before getting another. It seems that each cog  goes on a random level but always on the matching pole. Going down the  ladder leads you to a room with a rug with four colors on it. Each one  represents a cog.<br /><br /><h3>Black Cog</h3><br />   Following the path from the black door in the "rug room" you find the  cog near some ever burning fires. From being close to the flames has  heated it too hot to carry. This problem can be solved by one of two  ways. If you have your ice gloves from the hero quest they can be used  to pick up the cog. If you haven't done the hero quest you may just use a  bucket full of water on it to cool it so it can be picked up.<br /><br /><h3>Red Cog</h3><br />   Getting the red cog you must battle though a area infested with ogres  (level 5 [8)] you may not telegrab the cogs. So you can not get it from  the area that you go to for the monk friend quest.<br /><br /><h3>Blue Cog</h3><br />   The blue cog is in the "jail" area. This can only be reached from the  ladders just north of Brother Kojo. Each one leads to a different  "cell". There is 3 rows arranged as follows:<br /><br /><div class="left">   X X<br />X<br />X X X<br /></div>As you notice there isn't one leading to the cell with the blue cog in  it, but if you climb down the left one on the northern most row from the  western site (you will be facing right if your going the right way) you  will end up in the cell with the cog. There is a second way to get this  cog. Going west you will see a ladder out on it's own. Going down this  will lead you down a rather long path that leads to a "odd looking wall"  push on this and your in the cell with the blue cog.<br /><br /> <h3>Purple Cog</h3><br />  Perhaps the most annoying of all 4 of the cogs was this one. This cog is  in a rat's cage that is normally full of aggressive rats. While they are  not strong they are annoying and be prepared to take a while to get  though the cage. Going down the path you will find little branch off  that leads to a dead end with a bottle of rat poison in it. Take the rat poison and go back and follow the path to the leavers. Use the poison  on the food trough and go to the first lever you pasted getting to the  trough. Push this ladder and it will tell you about the rats eating the poison and dying. go back into the area where the rats spawn. The search  the rat cage (the fence that is between the rat spawn point and the  cog) if done right you will squeeze though and get the cog. Just climb  the ladder to get out of there.
