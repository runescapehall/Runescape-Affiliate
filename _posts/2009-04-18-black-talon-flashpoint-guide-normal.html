It is a Perfect entrance into the PvE world,  optimized for a group of four above level 10, offering an enormous  amount of story, some elementary and pleasantly entertaining boss  tactics and an allotment of respectable loot. It is a great preschool  for aspiring first time MMO gamers.<br /> The optimal group dynamic for this Flashpoint is:<br /> <ul><li>1 Tank</li><li>1 Healer</li><li>2 Dps</li></ul>After the completion of either Korriban or Hutta  you will be guided towards the Dromund Kaas via the Imperial Fleet.  However, once you reach the fleet’s departures lounge you are presented  with two options, you can either take a regular shuttle to Dromund Kaas  or you can take a route through the Black Talon Flashpoint.<br /><br /> Throughout the Flashpoint you will experience an assortment of group  dialogue scenes, all rewarding a scattering of Social Points for  everyone involved. Enemies generally present themselves in groups of 3-4  and a few rooms of trash mobs typically leads to a boss. Finally, be  sure to complete the Bonus Missions that present themselves to you as  these will lead to an additional Bonus Boss.<br /> <br /> <h3 style="text-align: center;">Bosses</h3><strong>GXR-5 Sabotage Droid</strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />One big nasty droid, who has a lot of friends. GXR-5 is a relatively  simple fight, but for those newer players to the MMO scene it can take a  couple of attempts. The tank’s job for this battle is untroublesome,  with the boss himself only having one real tactic to deal with, that  shouldn’t actually effect the tank. The tank should make the pull and  begin building threat while dragging the boss a good distance from his  original location. Almost immediately after, the DPS classes should  start pounding on GXR-5 and the healer should be keeping everybody  topped up in the health department. The fight will play out like a  normal ‘tank and spank’ with one differentiation.<br /><br />GXR-5 will randomly  spawn adds that will start at the point GXR-5 originated, target and  then chase one member of the team, they wont physically attack but they  will explode causing significant AoE damage; when this happens, the  Ranged DPS class should bring it down before it reaches the group. The  DPS should then start damaging GXR-5 again, with this process being  repeated each time an add spawns. If the Ranged DPS class can’t defeat  the add before it reaches the group, the tank should react by kiting  GXR-5 around the room, allowing some additional time for the Ranged DPS  to blast the add away.<br /><br /> This boss can drop the following loot:<br />[Black Talon Hunter's Boots]<br />[Black Talon Juggernaut's Gauntlets]<br />[Black Talon Juggernaut's Greaves]<br />[Black Talon Marauder's Tunic]<br />[Black Talon Operative's Jacket]<br /><br /> <strong>Commander Ghulil</strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />Another manageable fight. The tank should make the pull and start  building threat on the boss, with the DPS and healer kicking into gear  almost immediately after the tank gets aggro. During the battle,  Commander Ghulil will spawn floating orbs that do major AoE fire damage,  when this happens the tank should move the boss so that the group is  out of the range of the AoE damage, repeating the process until  Commander Ghulil goes down.<br /><br />The boss himself does little damage and  therefore the healer should have no trouble keeping everyone alive if  the orbs aren’t causing damage. Occasionally, you may notice a ring  start glowing around your player, if this happens, simply relocate to  prevent the incoming damage.<br /><br /> This boss can drop the following loot:<br />[Black Talon Sniper's Boots]<br />[Black Talon Sniper's Jacket]<br />[Black Talon Hunter's Body Armor]<br />[Black Talon Inquisitor's Gloves]<br />[Black Talon Juggernaut's Boots]<br />[Black Talon Keen-Edged Vibroknife<br />[Black Talon Marauder's Boots]<br />[Black Talon Marauder's Leggings]<br />[Black Talon Operative's Boots]<br /><br /> <strong>GXR-7 Command Droid (Bonus)</strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />If you have successfully completed all of the Black Talon bonus missions  then you will ultimately have to defeat GXR-7. There isn’t actually any  tactics to this battle, it is a pure DPS race. The tank should make the  pull and position himself with his back up against a wall to reduce the  impact of the boss’ knockback ability. GXR-7 outputs a tremendous  amount of damage, therefore the healer should keep the tank topped up at  all times and it is down to the DPS classes to get him down before he  drops the tank.<br /> This boss can drop the following loot:<br /><br />[Black Talon Inquisitor's Robe]<br />[Black Talon Juggernaut's Shield Generator]<br />[Black Talon Powertech's Power Generator]<br />[Esseles Vanguard's Shield Generator]<br /><br /> <strong>Yadira Ban</strong><br /><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />The final boss in the Black Talon; she is relatively easy but does take  some concentration from the entire group. The tank should make the pull  and start building threat with the DPS and healer initiating their  duties almost immediately. The fight is pretty much a ‘tank and spank’  other than her 2 abilities. The first is more of an annoyance than a  concern, where Yadira will randomly leap at a player and then leap back  to the tank, dealing a tiny amount of damage which shouldn’t concern the  healer too much.<br /><br />The second of her abilities is her most powerful;  every so often Yadira will pull everyone in the group towards her and  start building energy, displayed by blue rings swirling around her, when  this happens the entire group, including the tank, needs to run out of  the range of her coming AoE attack. Once Yadira has launched her powered  up AoE attack, the tank should regain aggro and continue with the  fight. Repeating this process should lead to a quick slaying of Yadira  Ban.<br /> This boss can drop the following loot:<br /><br />[Black Talon Deadeye's Exterminator]<br />[Black Talon Scout's Rifle]<br />[Corrupting Focus Lightsaber]<br />[Lightsaber of Vengeful Mastery]<br />[Warmonger's Saberstaff]<br /> <br /> <h3 style="text-align: center;">Alignment Points</h3>There are two events that happen during your progression through the  Black Talon. The first presents you with the option to either kill or  let live the Imperial Fleet captain, which awards either +100 Light Side  Points or +100 Dark Side Points depending on your decision.<br /><br /> The second event initiates at the end of the Flashpoint, where you  are presented with the option to either kill the General for +100 Dark  Side Points or capture him as a prisoner of war for +100 Light Side  Points.
