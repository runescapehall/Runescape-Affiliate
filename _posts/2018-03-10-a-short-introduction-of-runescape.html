You will find 8 combat levels. I will make a brief overview of each  combat skill. Attack: This skill influences how accurate your character  is utilizing a weapon. The attack skill enables a character to wield  greater weapons. It will be the primary skill of a character. Runescape  players have to level up attack skill immediately.<br /><br /> Strength: strength signifies the sum of damage your character can  deliver with a weapon. Boosting your strength skill can raise the sum of  damage you give. Quite a few weapons demand players to own a certain  level strength to use. Defense: This skill raises your ability to  dodge/block assaults. With this skill, you’ll be able to decrease damage  from your foes. Metal armors demand players to have a high defence <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504012541/http://gamesglod.com/topic/gold/" target="_blank">RS power level</a> to wear.<br /><br /> Constitution: Constitution level is in the past called hit points of  HP. Constitution level displays what amount of life points your  character has got. The life points decide how much damage your character  can take before death. Life points of your character means constitution  level times 10. When the life points of your character fall to 0, you  will die. Food can re-supply your life points and is often critical for  survival.<br /><br /> Ranged: Getting a high level in ranged skill, gamers may use better  bows as well as better armors. It seems like that ranged skill is the  mixture of attack and strength. A higher level ranged skill enables you  to hit with high accuracy.<br /><br /> Magic: With the help of magic skill, players can equip magic armor  and cast spells. Maximizing the magic level, players can use better  armors and have better accuracy with spells. Prayer: That is a  self-support magic-ish skill. Players can pray to Runescape  gods/Saradomin/ Guthix/Zamorak for aid in fights. Players can improve  the stats by initiating a prayer.<br /><br /> Summoning: This particular skill is only available for p2p players.  It won’t affect your combat level if you are a f2p gamer. Players could  summon familiars using this skill. The familiars can guidance you out in  battles by battling your opponents.<br /><br /> Players can generate numerous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130504012541/http://gamesglod.com/topic/gold/" target="_blank">Runescape gold</a> making good use of the combat skills.<br /><br /> You should get to know the aggressive Runescape monsters. Some  monsters can only be attacked. But there are monsters that will attack  players. You should get your character equipped with better weapons.
