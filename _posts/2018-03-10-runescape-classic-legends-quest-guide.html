They'll tell you  you need to do a quest to gain access, and to talk to sir radimus  erckle. He's in the small building inside the gates. He'll tell you that  to gain access you need to map the jungle in the south of karamja and  get a souvenir from the locals. He'll give you a scroll and a machette.<br /><br />Go to karamja and head to the small village just inside the jungle. Buy  at least 3 papyrus and 1 charcoal there (more are advised, since you can  lose them while mapping). Now continue to the far south of the jungle.  You'll come across an area closed off by mountains and plants. use the  machette on the plants to gain access to the area. Go to the far east or  west of the area, and read the scroll. When you get options, choose  map. Now start walking to the other side of the area, and after a while  read the scroll again and map again. Continue on to the other side of  the area, and map the last piece.<br /><br />Now leave the area again and use the scoll on one of the forresters just  outside it. He'll give you a bullroarer. Go back inside the area, and  use the bullroarer. Keep using it until Gujuo appears. He'll tell you  that to become friends with the natives, you need to gather them around a  totem, but unfortunately all totems are corrupted by evil. You'll have  to make a new one, and you'll need to make it from a special tree. There  is a shaman that can give you seeds for the tree. He can be found in a  cave hidden by 3 rocks in a triangle setting at the north side of the  area. Search the rocks to find the way down. Inside investigate the  flamewall and the guy inside will tell you you need pure water to get  through (along with a lot of nonsense). Go back outside, and swing the  bullroarer to talk to gujuo again. Ask him everything and he'll give you  a sketch of the item needed to hold the pure water. Get 2 gold bars and  use them on an anvil (while the scroll is in your inventory) and you'll  be able to make a glod bowl. Talk to Gujuo again and he'll help you  enchant the bowl. Now go to the small patch of water in the center of  the area and use the machette on a piece of reed. Use the reed you get  on the water. Go back to the cave. Use the pure water on the wall of  fire to go inside it(might need to do that a couple of times to get  inside if you do it in the wrong place). Use a weaken spell on the  shaman, and he'll tell you to get a book from deaper in the cave.<br /><br />Search the bookcases until you find the one that lets you crawl through a  hole. Use a lockpick on the doors you find inside. When you get  through, use your pickaxe on the boulders to get past them. Try to push  open the gate that lies behind the boulders. When you get through  continue on past the lvl 80 bats, until you come to a wall that you have  to jump over. Now you need to use runes on the ancient wall. Use them  in this sequence: soul rune, mind rune, earth rune, law rune, law rune.  In the cave you enter use a cut diamond, ruby, emerald, sapphire, opal,  red topaz and jade on the spikes in the lakes. Try them on a spike until  it appears above it for a while. When you place the final gem, you'll  get a book, the Book of Binding. Go back to the cave. Now you need to  use the book on the shaman, but before you do that, make sure you are  ready for the fight. Once you use the book on him you'll have to fight a  lvl 172 demon that will vanish if you run and will drain most of your  prayer (silverlight helps). Once you beat the demon the shaman is freed  and will give you a fire pass and the needed seeds. Use holy water on  the seeds to germinate them (the bowl will be empty after this). Use the  pass on the fire to get out.<br /><br />Go outside and try to fill the bowl again (same method as before). It'll  tell you that the pool has dried up. Use the bullroarer and talk to  Gujuo again. He'll tell you to find the source of the water deep into  the cave, and tell you you need a potion from snake weed and adringal.  He'll tell you where to find them (they are the same places as in the  jungle potion quest). Make the potion. Now you need to go back to the  place you used the gems. Be sure to take the items needed for a fight  before you go, since you'll have to redo stuff if you get out later. Use  a charge orb spell on the gate (any charge orb spell will work). Now  smash open the barrels, until you get a rope. Drink the potion, and use  the rope on the wooden thing at the hole. Climb down. When you get to  the new room, don't go down the stairs yet, but try to pick up the  wizards hat. A ghost will appear that will tell you that you have  prooven your courage, and that you need to prove your strength. You do  this by fighting the monsters in the cave.<br /><br />Go down the stairs, and fight  one of the monsters at the end (lvl 120). Beat it to get a crystal. Go  further in the cave, and fight one of the lvl 125 creatures, and get the  crystal from him too. Repeat this with the lvl 130 creature at the end  of the cave. Now go to the north of the cave (past the walls) and find a  lava furnace. Use all 3 pieces on the furnace, and you'll get a heart  shaped crystal. Now look at you're minimap. The walls in this area look  like a dragon's head. Go to the eye of the dragon and use the crystal on  the rocks there. The crystal will become powered. Now go to the end of  the cave and use the powered crystal on the cave mouth. After doing  that, go through it and go past the lesser demons.<br /><br />Try moving one of the  boulders near the water. A ghost will appear and ask you to kill the  ghost at the top of the stairs. Agree to do that, and you'll get a dark  dagger. Go to the other ghost (pick up the hat) and attack him. He'll  die instantly. Go back to the boulders. Now prepare for the next big  fight. When you try to move a boulder the ghost will appear, and turn  into the lvl 172 demon. This time he drains all prayer. Defeat the  demon. Once the demon is gone, move all 3 the boulders. Go back outside.<br /><br />Get some pure water. Now find a patch of fertile soil, and use the seeds  on it. A tree will start to grow. It'll ask for pure water a couple of  times. When it is big enough, quickly use your hatchet on it. The tree  will fall down. Use your hatchet on the fallen tree. Use your hatchet  again on the trimmed tree to turn it into a totem. Pick up the totem (it  will temporarily drain your strength). Now prepare for the last fight.<br /><br />You need to replace one of the infected totems with the one you just  made. As soon as you try to replace the totem, you'll have to fight the  lvl 120, 125 and 130 creatures and the lvl 172 demon in a row. The demon  will not drain full prayer this time, but will still take a lot. Once  you have defeated all of them, replace the corrupted totem with the new  one (you might need to try it a few times. Sometimes it won't replace  it). Gujuo will appear and thank you. You'll get a gilded totem pole. Go  back to the legends guild, and use the map on Radimus Erckle. Nect use  the totem on him, and you'll be allowed to enter the guild. Go into the  other building and talk to Radimus again. Congratulations, you have  finished the quest. <br /><h2>Addendum</h2>This Quest is easier in RuneScape than in RuneScape classic, as you will  be able to eat and use potions while fighting the Demon. The Quest is  basically the same except some of the levels of the enemies are  different under the new combat system. The three ghosts you have to  fight to get the crystals are now Level 96, 100, and 106. The big black  demon is level 187.
