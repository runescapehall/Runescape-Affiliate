Say you will help.  He will give you railing replacements, to replace damaged parts that the  goblins have caused. Now, to the south, you will find railings,  connecting the gates, head past the gates. You will have to find the  broken railings to replace them. Failing to replace them, which rarely  happens, results in losing about four health. One of these replacements  is right to the east of the very eastern gate. The second is west of the  eastern-most gate, and is against a wooden support log.<br /><br />Another is a  diagnal railing in between the second and third eastern gates. Another  will be found to the west of the third eastern gate, and is up against a  tree. If you head west you will note a grave in the shape of a cross.  The railing east of that will need to be replaced, which should be right  below a wooden support log. The last one that will need to be replaced  will be the very northwestern one. You will have to go inside the gated  area to fix this one.<br /><br /> Now, talk to the commander again. He will now ask you to head south, and  check up on one of his guards in a watch tower. Just a little bit to  the south (it will be a square-shaped building on the map) will be the  watch tower. You will find the dwarven remains in the tower, which you  must bring back to the commander. Now the commander says that Gilob's  (the dead dwarf) son was with him. He will ask that you find the goblin  hideout so you can bring his son back. Go back to the watch tower.<br /><br />You  will find goblin tracks, which, when you examine them, say they lead  south east. Just follow the tracks. If you get lost, then simply go east  of the fishing guild, where you will find a cave. Enter the cave. This  is the goblin hideout, which is a bit of a maze. Take the northern  route, and head west when you read a dead-end. Once you reach a dead-end  in that direction, take a north, where you will find a room full of  crates. Go to the north-western corner of the room and search one crate  east of that one. You will find the dwarf child here, who goes off  without you back to the dwarf base. Exit the caves by heading the way  you came from,  then climbing up the mudpile.<br /><br /> Now head back to the commander. He asks you to do him another favor,  which is, to repair the dwarf cannon. He will give you some tools. Just  head in the little building next to him, which was previously locked.  Unless you're blind, you will see a huge cannon. Choose the option to  inspect it. It will say that four different parts are broken, and will  ask which you want to fix.<br /><br />If it says you cannot find any problems,  inspect it again. Try fixing each of these items, if you fail, try  again. After it says that you have fixed each part, talk to the  commander. He will now ask for one final favor, which will be to find  out what kind of ammo the cannon uses. For this, you will need to go to  the enterance of the dwarf mine. This is where your Falador teleporting  runes will come in handy, if you brought them. If not, or if you can't  cast the spell, then have fun walking.<br /><br /> When you arrive there, you will need to go through the dwarf mine house.  There will be another door, leading to a fenced in area with dwarven  engineers. Talk to one of them. He will give you a cannon ball mould and  a note. Read the note, and learn a bit more about this ammo used for  the steel cannon. Take the mould and note back to the dwarven commander.  If you brought Camelot teleport runes, then this is where they will  become valuable. When you talk to him, you will lose the mould and the  notes. Though you have now completed the quest!<br /><br /> Reward: One quest point and the ability to buy a dwarf cannon. To buy  the cannon, talk to the dwarven engineer. He can sell you the full  cannon for 750,000 (which includes all the pieces) or each piece for  200,000 each (remember there are four pieces, so you only want to do  that if you lost a few of the pieces). You can also buy a manual here,  which tells you more about the cannon, and you may also buy the cannon  mould, to make the ammo.
