<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="d"><tbody><tr><th>Length</th><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><th>Difficulty</th><td>Easy</td></tr><tr><th>Requirements</th><td>Although it's not a requirement, it's recommended that you have a decent combat level (around level thirty).</td></tr><tr><th>Suggested items</th><td>Bear, rat, chicken, and cow meat.

He wants  to purify the stone circle and the druid Sanfew can tell you how. Talk  to Sanfew in a small house in Northern Tavelry. He asks of you that you  put the meat of four animals in a special cauldron. Get four types of  raw meat: Bear, Rat, Chicken, and Cow.<br /><br />   Then take them to the huge members dungeon south of Tavelry. Along the  first hallway you will see a door with two suits of armor outside it,  try to open the door and the suits will attack you, kill them and you  can go into the room with the cauldron. If you cannot kill these suits  of armor then you can take the alternate, longer route. Use each of the  meats with the cauldron and return to Sanfew. He thanks you and takes  the meat. He also tells you to talk to Kaqwemeex again. Go talk to  Kaqwemeex for your reward.  <br />
