Gold rocks are scattered all around Runescape world. But what is the best place to mine gold? <br /><br />Well, there are four places I would recommend. Yes, one of them is very  well known Crafting Guild, but it would be only #4 on my list. Take a  look.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857/http://www.runetower.com/Gold-Mining-for-Members.php#1">Number One (Arzinian Gold Mine)</a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857/http://www.runetower.com/Gold-Mining-for-Members.php#2">Number Two (Horseshoe)</a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857/http://www.runetower.com/Gold-Mining-for-Members.php#3">Number Three (Brimhaven Southwest Mine)</a><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857/http://www.runetower.com/Gold-Mining-for-Members.php#4">Number Four (Crafting Guild)</a><br /><br /><a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/null" name="1"></a><i><b><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Number One (Arzinian Gold Mine)</span></b></i><br /><br />This mine becomes available after completion of the <b>Between a Rock quest</b>.  The quest is not hard, but it requires level 50 Smithing. If you don’t  have this level, look for other options below. It is also recommended to  have activated Ring of Charos with you when using this mine (You’ll see  later why). To get Ring of Charos you should complete the <b>Creature of Fenkenstrain quest</b> which is quite easy (the only big requirement is level 25 Thieving). To activate the ring the <b>Garden of Tranquillity quest</b> needs to be done (also not hard but requires level 25 Farming).<br /><br />If you have <i>activated </i>Ring of Charos, this mine is <b>THE BEST</b> place to mine and bank gold ore.<br /><br />Here are the steps that describe how to use it.<br /><br />1. First of all you need to get to the mine. This is the most complex  part, lol. Here is how I usually get in there: take a cart to the  Keldagrim city, walk north and take a boat to the ‘mines’. Talk to the  ferryman and ask him to get you to another side of the river. Note that  you don’t have to pay him if you have Ring of Charos.<br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Gold Mining for Members/pic1.jpg" /><br /><br />2. Walk to Dondakan who is managing cannon in front of the mine. Wear your Gold Helmet and ask him to shoot you into the rock.<br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Gold Mining for Members/pic2.jpg" /><br /><br />3. Mine gold. Usually nobody is there. But even if someone is in, the  mine is HUGE. Only in the first room there are 10 rocks. It is over 140  in the whole mine.<br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Gold Mining for Members/pic3.jpg" /><br /><br />4. Leave one slot empty and remove your helmet to get back up.<br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Gold Mining for Members/pic4b.jpg" /><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Gold Mining for Members/pic4.jpg" /><br /><br />5. Walk east to the boatman and ask him to take your gold to the bank.<br />He will ask for 6 gold ores as a payment, but if you have Ring of Charos, you’ll be able to drop the price to 3 ores. <br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Gold Mining for Members/pic5.jpg" /><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Gold Mining for Members/pic6.jpg" /><br /><br />6. Pay and go back to the mine. <br /><br />That’s it. Very quick trip from the mine to the banking spot (boatman).<br /><br /><a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/null" name="2"></a><i><b><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Number Two (Horseshoe)</span></b></i><br /><br />Horseshoe is a little known gold mine on Karamja. It has 10 gold rocks  and is not that far away from the boat. However, if you can, move your  house to Karamja and access this mine from the house. It is much quicker  than boat from Adougne. Another advantage of accessing the mine from  your house is that you can choose to teleport to Falador from the mine  and smelt gold bars right on the spot BEFORE visiting a bank. Basically,  you save a separate trip to furnace by using this way.<br /><br />Other ways to get to/from this mine are:<br />1) Cart to Shilo Village in both directions (of course, the Shilo Village Quest is required)<br />2) You can use Dueling Rings to teleport from the mine to Castle Wars and bank the ore there.<br />3) You can use Glory Amulet to teleport from the mine to Edgeville and bank the ore there.<br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Gold Mining for Members/pic7.jpg" /><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Gold Mining for Members/map.jpg" /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/null" name="3"></a><b><i><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Number Three (Brimhaven Southwest Mine)</span></i></b><br /><br />Similar to Horseshoe mine, but has only 6 rocks. It is closer to the  house entrance, so if you are OK with 6 rocks (meaning your mining is  low) – go for it.<br /><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Gold Mining for Members/pic8.jpg" /><br /><img alt="" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220190857im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Gold Mining for Members/map2.jpg" /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/null" name="4"></a><b><i><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Number Four (Crafting Guild)<br /></span></i></b><br />7 rocks, could be crowded. A bit longer walk to the bank.<br />The best place for F2P players.
