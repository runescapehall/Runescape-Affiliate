<div class="fright"><div id="content"><div class="center">This writing is a record of the ancient times. Much is questionable guesswork but the records are far  less than complete. As more is discovered this document will expand and change.    </div><h2>The First Age</h2>Creation of RuneScape. Giants briefly are dominate species (according to ancient records), but are soon  supplanted by Elves, Gnomes, Men, and Dwarves. First clashes between Zamorak and Saradomin. <br />  <h2>The Second Age</h2>The race of Elves wiped out or driven off by Dark Forces from the West. Baxtorian makes his waterfall  refuge and hides the treasures of the elves. Whatever remaining Elves there were vanished completely.  The only remaining sources of information on the Elves are magically defended and preserved locations  like the Baxtorian Waterfall and the tomb of Glarial. This is also the first mention of the Rune Stones,  powerful stones capable of many wonders.  <br />  <h2>The Third Age</h2>The White Knights of Falador launch the Dawn Ascension, they drive the Black Knights back into their  stronghold by the Wilderness and Iban is killed. It is persumed that Zamorak had a larger and more open  following of men before this time, even if it was slavery and obedience through fear. At this time the  dwarves may have recovered many of the lost Elvish treasures, according to the 'Book of Baxtorian'  which was compiled in the fifth age.  <br />  <h2>The Fourth Age</h2>Scorpius builds first telescope, communes with Zamorak and becomes a follower of Evil in exchange for  foresight. This is an interesting contradiction, that a man of science would chose to follow the  Chaotic One. Even more surprising that Zamorak would even accept such a person into his retinue.  Scorpius' doomed spirit and his followers still haunt his grave site near a Zamorakian place of  worship. At this time the war between Saradomin and Zamorak became so intense the world itself was  nearly toppled, we can assume that it was at this time the original telescope was lost and the last  remnants of elder civilizations like the Elves and the Zaros Cult were buried, if not out rightly  destroyed.  <br />  <h2>The Fifth Age</h2>At the beginning of the Fifth age, Saradomin and Zamorak made a pact (possibly compelled by Guthix) not  to directly interfere with the affairs of RuneScape. They handed that governorship over to the greatest  mage of the era, Gower, who has continued their work. Zamorak and Saradomin continue to guide their  servants from a far. Lately, many uprisings of the sleepless Zamorakian dead have occurred. Scorpius,  Iban, Khazard, and Zombie Quenn on Karamja. Iban and the Zombie Queen both brought powerful armies back  from the grave against mankind while Khazard nearly succeeded in destroying one of the only two known  settlements of Gnomes. This seems to be a intentional attack against all the living, who knows how much  further it could go? We think that even Guthix finds Zamorak's reliance on the undead reprehensible  because they break the natural cycles of life and death, unbalancing the universe.  <br />  <h2>The Gods</h2><b>Saradomin</b> probably the most publicly and widely acknowledged god of mankind; alters to Saradomin can be  found quite easily in most any town. Saradomin is the god of reason and order, 'Strength through  Wisdom' is his motto. He is closely connected with magic and prayer. However, the Zaros Followers were  so thoroughly destroyed by Saradomists, Zaros's existence has only now been discovered. Saradomin   despises Zamorak and his like, they've been at war almost from the begriming of the world. Saradomin's  recent communications with his people (and the outright theft of that means of communication by Zamorak)  reveal that the fraternal strife between them is far from over.  <br />    <b>Zamorak</b> although mankind gives a fairly good show of following the wisdom of Saradomin, alters to the  Dark god can still be found in the slums of large cities or in dark strongholds beyond the boundaries  of mainstream civilization. Zamorak is the god of Chaos and Evil, he is filled to the brim with spite  and disgust for everything and everyone, he delights in all death and mayhem, even when it is directed  at his own servants. Some of them are so hostile they even avoid each other. In the fifth age, most his  human (and living) servents have been beaten down by Saradomists (or just people that don't want to be  randomly decapitated whilst mining). Zamorak has come to rely more and more on undead, which can  disturbingly involve the local extinction of the human race. It may be that Zamorak is trying to  supplant mankind completely.  <br />    <b>Guthix</b> has been known of for some time, but his position is ambiguous at best. "I am both, I am  neither, I am Guthix". Guthix has a small following of Humans, which unlike Saradomists and Zamorakians  rely on herblaw, and possibly very ancient magic. Just where Guthix stands on an issue or what he will  actually do is always questionable. Guthix is apparently the god of the Dwarves, who mostly keep  whatever religious rites they observe to themselves. The numbers of henges and Dolmens scattered  across RuneScape also suggest that the Guthix Cult was once far larger. But it is presently composed  of a tight-nit group of introverted herbalists who refuse to do any more traffic with the outside world  than necessary. Guthix is enigmatic, but he also has revealed he still maintains RuneScape and its  creatures in their natural cycles.  <br />    <b>Zaros and the vanquished gods</b> until very recently, it was thought that the three primary gods  were all the existed in RuneScape. However clear evidence of at least one additional deity has been  found in the area west of Varrock. Zaros seems to be a Chaotic god like Zamorak, but his following  was completely overrun by Saradomists and almost every trace of his religion destroyed. It is unknown  if these gods still exist or if they are bound by the pact between Saradomin and Zamorak that places  all power in the hands of the Mage Gower.  <br />  <h2>Races</h2><b>Man</b> - by far the most evident and widely distributed (both in philosophically and spatially) race.   Human settlements can be found almost anywhere. Humans, at least in general and publicly, serve  Saradomin with only a relatively small cult obeying Zamorak and a even smaller one aligned to Guthix.  But of course there are thieves, slavers, barbarians, and primitives who don't acknowledge any gods  and are in entirely for their own.  <br />    <b>Dwarves</b> - solitary and moody, the dwarves have been around at least as long as men, but haven't bothered  making their prescience felt very often. The Dwarves owe mild allegience to Guthix. A very distant  branch of the dwarfish race, however, is fanatically Zamorakian. The Chaos Dwarves are mostly driven  into solitary places where they can take adventurers unawares with little threat of reprisal. The  dwarves have settlements of various sizes all over RuneScape.  <br />    <b>Gnomes</b> - long hidden in remote strongholds or through confusing mazes, Gnomes have (cheerfully)  barricaded themselves against the world. Their small size and cleverness make them the targets of evil  factions of men, who hunt and slaughter stray gnomes. The only gnome settlements are far to the West  along the impassable mountain range. It is unknown what deity the gnomes follow but they are certainly  closely aligned with nature.  <br />    <b>Elves</b> - very little is known about the elves, except that they were once powerful and inhabited  the now empty regions far north of Ardougne. Baxtorian, the last king of the Elves, lead a five year  campaign against the forces of Evil which apparently succeeded. Somehow, enemies slipped behind  Baxtorian's forces and laid waste to the Elvish lands so the victors returned only to empty ruins.  Most of the Elves were simply gone, Baxtorian's wife Glarial was found dead. Baxtorian was insane with  grief, he abandoned his armies and the remnants of his people, entering his magical Waterfall fortress  and never came forth. Legend says he was waiting for Glarial's return, even after she was buried in  state and defended by the Natural Forces of Runes which He and Glarial had much power over. The race of  Elves seems now to be extinct or hidden very distant as yet unexplored lands.  <br />    <b><i>This represents only the least beggining of the chronicling of RuneScape.
