What do I do?<br /><br /><b>A.)</b> You have a charged glory amulet on you, use it. <br /><br /><b>Q.)</b> OMG!!1 I used my lyre’s last charge and can’t get back to the Fremennik  trails place<br /><br /><b>A.)</b> Sorry buddy, teleport to Camelot and grab a raw shark. Walk back up there and recharge your lyre while you’re at it.<br /><br /><b>Q.)</b> How much does snape grass sell for each?<br /><br /><b>A.)</b> 500 Minimum, 1000 maximum.  <br /><br /><b>Q.)</b>  How much money have you made collecting snape grass?<br /><br /><b>A.)</b> 2.5 Million in 3 days.<br /><br /><b>Q.)</b> How do I get my lyre back if I lost it?<br /><br /><b>A.)</b> There are 2 ways to get your lyre back. These are as follow:<br /><br />1) There is a NPC named Lanzig that drops the lyre when you kill him. He is found in this hut.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b><span style="color: red;">Note:</span></b> Lanzig does not ALWAYS drop the lyre, it's not a rare drop but it's not  common either. It'll take you a good hour to finally get that lyre, but  in the end. Its worth it.<br /><br />2)  There is another way to get a lyre, it's basiclly you repeating that  exact same part of the quest. This part is as follows. Quoted from  Zybez.com.<br /><br /><div class="quotetop">QUOTE</div><div class="quotemain">Now,  talk to the Olaf the Bard (Picture)who says he is a member of the  council. To gain his vote he wants you to prove that you have musical  talent, so he wants you to write an epic. Talk to him again and he will  tell you of a musical tree, south of the town that makes very good  instruments. Then he will tell you of a Troll, to the south east that  has golden wool that could be used to string your lyre. Then you will  need the blessing of the Fossegrimen, a lake spirit to the south west,  to tune the lyre. He says that an offering of fish may be necessary to  convince the Fossegrimen to do this. Then he says when you're done all  that to perform in the long hall.<br />Strategy: Go to Seer's Village and  withdraw your Hatchet, Knife, Beer, and the three vegetables (Onion,  Potato, and Cabbage). Also bring 2 sets of Camelot teleport runes, a  weapon, and a small amount of food to kill a Level 69 foe.<br /><br />34) Go  to the entrance of the city and head directly east until you reach the  Swaying Tree (Picture). Cut a branch off it and then use your knife on  the branch to get an 'unstrung lyre'.<br /><br />35) Next, go just southeast  of here to Lalli's home (Picture) and ask about golden wool. You will  be sent away after being told that Askeladden stole some of his wool.<br /><br />36)  Go speak to him, In front of the longhall. He will explain how he  tricked Lalli into trading his pet rock to 'guard the golden apples' for  golden wool. He will give you a pet rock.<br /><br />37) Go back and talk  to Lalli, but she won't fall for the pet rock trick again. However, you  will think up some cunning plan that involves the pet rock, an onion, a  potato, and a cabbage. Talk to Lalli again and you will explain to him  how to make 'stone soup', which is a 'delicacy'. Use your pet rock,  onion, potato, and cabbage with Lalli's Stew, and he will agree that the  soup is very tasty. Talk to him again and he trade you 'Golden Fleece'.  He will also says, 'HA! I tricked you human!' because he thinks that he  got a rare soup making stone. Use this fleece on a spinning wheel to  get 'Golden Wool' then use it on your lyre, to make a complete lyre.<br />Strategy: Teleport to Camelot and use the Spinning Wheel south of the bank.<br /><br />38)  Now go to the village again but as you get to the point where the dirt  tracks cross the road just south head southwest until you find a small  shrine in the water. Use a Raw Shark on the strange alters and a  Fossegrimen will appear to enchant the lyre (Picture). You can now play  it perfectly.<br /><br />39) Go back to the village and go through the door  that the 'Longhall Bouncer' is guarding. Go up onto the stage and 'Play'  your enchanted lyre. You will sing about some of your accomplishments.  You will sing so well that you will be commended by the Bard. He says  that you have his vote in becoming a Fremennik.<br /></div><br /><br /><b>Q.)</b> How do I get Boots of Lightness?<br /><b>A.)</b> Go into the underground Temple next to the Ranged Guild. You do <b>not</b> have to start the <u>Temple of Ikov</u> quest. Although you do need to have something lit (candle, lantern, or  cave goblin mining helmet) and something that can Slash (or a knife).<br /><br /><b>Q.)</b> But zOMG? Why would I do this when I could get them from Hobgoblin Island next to the Crafting Guild?<br /><b>A.)</b> Because at Hobgoblin Island, there's always 2 other people picking  them, only 3 respawns, and the respawn slower. On Waterbirth Island,  it's almost always empty, 6 respawns, and they respawn fast enough so  that when you've picked the last one the first one is respawning again!<br /><br /><b>Q.)</b> Why not just bank your whole inventory with Peer the Seer?<br /><b>A.)</b> Because, Peer only banks your items while you're doing <u>The Fremnik Trials</u> quest, if you haven't started it yet, or have finished it already, he won't bank anything for you.<br /><br /><b>Q.)</b> Okay! I have a great idea. Why not make a new character that's started The Fremnik Trials, but not finished it?<br /><b>A.)</b> Well, you could do that, but then you'd have to pay a fee to get on the  boat to Waterbirth Island. Then, how would you pay when Peer deposites  your whole inventory, including the Cash?<br /><span style="color: red;"><b>Note:</b></span> You could actually do this if you carried around the cash, and right  before you ask Peer to deposite your inventory, you drop the cash on the  ground, then deposite your inventory, then pick it up again. You'd use  up the cash as you travel to Waterbirth Island. The good side about this  is that you wouldn't have to pay for teleports.<br /><br /><b>Q.)</b> Would it be faster to take the boat to Miscellania then bank in Etceteria?<br /><b>A.)</b> No.<br /><br /><b>Q.)</b> Would it be useful to use Dueling Rings and teleport to Caste Arena to bank instead of Glories to Edgeville?<br /><b>A.)</b> It would be a little bit faster, but after Dueling Rings run out of  their 8 charges, they break. Glories on the other hand can be recharged.  You can charge 28 Glories at a time (27 in inventory, 1 equiped, 1  Charged Games Room necklace in inventory) with a Games Room necklace.  Games Necklaces are cheaper than Dueling rings aswell. If you already  have the Glories, or plan to do a lot of runs and don't have the  Glories, using Glory Amulets is much cheaper.
