## Why does Twitch Prime allow for so many bots in Oldschool Runescape?

You can start trials on new twitch accounts and cancel right after redeeming the membership. This allows for bot farm operators to create a ton of accounts and farm suicide farm gold in a short period of time. Thieving blots, like those at Pyramid Plunder or Master Farmers, are quite popular with this method.
