The only PvP Warzone where  the opposing teams can be of the same faction. Huttball takes place in  the Pit, a location based on Nar Shaddaa, and plays much like an  American Football or Rugby game. The ball spawns in the center of the  map and each team battles to it. Each side will continuously fight for  possession of the ball so that they can score. In order to score, a  player must carry the ball over the opposing team’s goal line on the  opposite side of the map. The game concludes when one team reaches 6  points or the 15 minute timer expires. In the event of a tie, after 15  minutes, the last team to score is victorious.<br /><br /> The Pit is laid out in a rectangular shape with each team’s spawn  point at opposite longitudinal ends. Just in front of each of these is  the team’s goal line and then a large pit. Fixed above the pits are a  set of upper and lower scaffolding with 4 flame pits, used to transverse  the map. Finally there are 2 Acid pits and 2 Air Lifts forming a square  that surrounds the ball spawn point.<br /><br /> The game is overseen by Giradda the Hutt and players either compete as one of the RotWorms (purple) or FrogDogs (gold).<br /> <span> </span><br /> <h3 style="text-align: center;">Playstyle</h3>There are two different approaches players can take when they get the  ball, they can either pass or run. Running is quite simple and is best  done by finding a group of players and preferably a healer, and slowly  making your way to the opposing team’s endzone, obliterating everything  in your path. On the other hand, players can choose to pass the ball, by  throwing it into an area and hoping another player is in position to  reclaim it. There are many more advanced strategies, all of which I will  cover in this article.<br /> <span> </span><br /> <h3 style="text-align: center;">Hazards</h3><strong>Acid Pits</strong><br />Between each side’s pit and the ball spawn point is a rectangular  shaped, green, acid pit. You really don’t want to get caught in here as  it will soon drop your health to zero. Avoid these at all costs, though  do happily make use of your knockback abilities to cripple your  opponents.<br /> <strong>Flame Pits</strong><br />Like the Acid Pits, these will soon kill you. There are 8 flame pits on  the map, 4 on each side, 2 on each side’s upper scaffolding and 2 on  each side’s lower scaffolding. The flame pits run on a set timer; try to  get a feel for them as they will block your way when trying to score.<br /> <strong>Air Lifts</strong><br />Air Lifts are located to the right and left of the ball spawn point and  are used for a means of transportation and escape. When a player stands  on one of these lifts they will be blown high into the air, slowly  moving in a random direction. The fall from the air lifts will not harm  the player.<br /> <span> </span><br /> <h3 style="text-align: center;">Power-Ups</h3><strong>Speed Boost</strong><br />The speed boost power-up is located in the center of each team’s pit and  allows the bearer to move significantly faster for a short period of  time.<br /> <strong>Health Pack</strong><br />The 4 health packs are found in each corner of the map, just past each  side’s scaffolding. As you would expect, they restore some of the  player’s health.<br /> <strong>Power Boost</strong><br />Power Boosts are centered on the far longitudinal edges of the map and  increase the damage and healing a player can exert for a short period of  time.<br /> <span> </span><br /> <h3 style="text-align: center;">Offense</h3>Irrelevant of how many kills you are getting, you can’t win without  scoring. Below are a few strategies to make sure your team is holding  the trophy when the dust settles:<br /> <ul><li><strong>Rush Tactics</strong> – Rushes cannot be completed by just  one man, occasionally you will find one sneaky player run through unseen  and score, though this is not so much a rush as it is just being sneaky  and stealthy. Rush tactics must include several members of the team and  are executed by the group ploughing through the enemy team with the  ball carrier. The biggest advantage of a rush is that the enemy can  easily be caught off guard and if you are going to die, it is easy to  retain possession.</li><li><strong>Passing</strong> – Passing is one of the most fundamental  parts of Huttball. When you first enter the warzone, an ability to throw  the ball is placed on one of your action bars. Passing plays shouldn’t  just be random flings of the ball; they should be made to open players  who are expecting the ball. Don’t underestimate passing, as it can allow  you to cover ground rapidly and outsmart the competition in seconds.  Passing is also great for retaining possession, as once you die the  enemy who defeated you gains possession of the ball, however, if you  pass the ball just prior to dying you can allow your team to keep  pushing forward.</li><li><strong>Up is Down</strong> – The Up is Down play is a little more  advanced and is accomplished by two players running positive lines  towards the goal. One player opts for the upper scaffolding route and  the other takes the lower scaffolding route. While progressing, each  player passes back and forth to each other to avoid the flame pits and  any incoming enemies.</li><li><strong>Stay out of the Pit</strong> – Those pits are like the  plague to a good offense. Once you fall into the pit, you will have to  run all the way back around to start moving forward again. This becomes  even more of a problem when the ball carrier can’t move at 100% speed.  If you do end up in the pit with the ball, make a pass to a teammate as  soon as possible because otherwise you are just a sitting duck.</li><li><strong>Speed Play</strong> – Have one of your teams Sith  Inquisitors or Jedi Consulars stand in an opportune position while  stealthed, on top of the enemy scaffolding possibly. Once your team  gains possession, throw a precision pass directly to him/her. The  stealthed player must remove his/her stealth in order to retrieve the  ball, therefore they should do this immediately and then claim the  passed ball. As soon as they have possession they should make use of  their speed boost abilities and make a direct run at the enemy’s goal  line.</li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;">Defense</h3>A good defense is a good offense, and you definitely can’t win if the  other team keep scoring. Below are a few tips to make sure your  defensive game is helping you succeed:<br /> <ul><li><strong>Zone Defense</strong> – A tactic borrowed from the age old  game of Basketball, where each player stands strong in a position of the  map and lays waste to anyone foolish enough to step inside their  territory. Sounds simple and it can be very effective.</li><li><strong>Hold the Line</strong> – Another great tactic is to spread  your team out between your goal line and the midfield, covering the  upper scaffolding, center field, side ramps and lower scaffolding. This  is probably the strongest defensive tactic and allows for easy counters  once your team gains possession.</li><li><strong>Stay Alive</strong> – With quick respawns and a large group  of teammates it is easy to forget the effects of dying. While you are  waiting to respawn the other team have a huge advantage and can easily  capitalize on your team’s low player count. Of course, at times you are  going to die, it happens, however instead of just rolling over to those 4  players beating on you, jump down into the pit and hope they follow  you. If they do, you die and 4 of the enemy team’s players are  effectively out of the game for a good few seconds. If they don’t, you  live and you are right near a health pack.</li><li><strong>Make use of those knockbacks</strong> – Most players have  some sort of knockback ability. Make sure that whenever you are fighting  the enemy ball carrier on your team’s scaffolding, you use your  knockback ability to push them down into the pit, neutralizing their  assault.</li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;">Player Tips</h3>After hundreds of games of Huttball I have encountered many different  scenarios, learning from each defeat and respecting each victory. The  following tips include everything I have learned and should help you  dominate Huttball:<br /> <ul><li><strong>Sprint </strong>- Every player at some point unlocks the  ability to sprint, increasing their movement speed by 35% when outside  of combat. Ensure this is always on so that you can keep up with  everyone else.</li><li><strong>Buffs Baby</strong> – When the game is starting, be sure to  buff all of your teammates and make sure you receive all of theirs. That  5% extra damage can be the deciding factor in some battles.</li><li><strong>Boost</strong> – Inquisitors and Consulars can use their  speed boost abilities to make a jump from the upper scaffolding to the  enemy’s goal line platform. Thus allowing them to skip past the final  flame pit.</li><li><strong>Interception</strong> – All passes can be intercepted and  you should always be trying to. If there is a pass heading towards an  open area, be sure to grab the free ball whether you want it or not. You  can always pass it to a teammate.</li><li><strong>Hot Potato</strong> – If you are about to die and have  nobody to offload the ball too, toss it into an open area far from any  enemy players to reset the ball. This will allow your team to regroup  and reclaim possession. Also, if you have teammates sprinting towards  you, yet still out of passing range, throw the ball at an enemy player  with low health. This will give your team the opportunity to slay the  adversary and easily reclaim the ball.</li><li><strong>Invisibility</strong> – Another tactic for forcing a ball  reset it to enter stealth. In battle stealth abilities can be a  brilliant way of staying alive and resetting the ball.</li><li><strong>Burn Baby Burn</strong> – Make use of your knockbacks and  Crowd Control (CC) abilities to gain easy kills. Knock a player back  into an acid pit or flame pit, or wait until someone foolishly walks  across one and hit them with a CC. It won’t take long for them to drop  inside one of these perfect traps.</li><li>Change Direction – If you continuously carry the ball the same route  or pass it the second you grab it, the opposition will soon catch on.  Avoid being predictable and always keep them guessing.</li><li><strong>Mine</strong> – Inquisitors and Consulars can make use of  their speed boosting abilities at the start of a game to ensure your  team obtain the ball first. It is best for them to head backwards and  regroup once they claim the ball otherwise they will be an easy target.  On the other hand, if the enemy team has applied this tactic, hit them  with a long range CC so that your team have time to lock on.</li><li><strong>Offload</strong> – Always be sure to pass the ball to the closest teammate prior to dying.</li><li><strong>Chain the Points</strong> – If your team are wreaking havoc  and are about to score, set yourself up on the ball respawn points and  grab it as soon as they score. The enemy team are already on the back  foot and it shouldn’t be too hard to score with half of your team  already in their endzone.</li><li><strong>Leap of Faith</strong> – This tactic requires a lot of skill  and just a hint of luck. If you are a Sith Warrior or Jedi Knight who  is carrying the ball and find yourself in the pit, target the first  opponent you see coming from the enemy endzone and Force Leap your way  right next to the goal line.</li><li><strong>Sacking</strong> – If you see a pass about to land on an  enemy player, use one of your knockback abilities to push them out of  the way, either allowing you to intercept the pass or cause a ball  reset.</li><li><strong>Line of Sight</strong> – Whether you class can go in cover  or not, you should always be using your surroundings effectively to  create line of sight (LoS) issues for your opponents.</li><li><strong>Unfair Advantage</strong> – At the start and end of a game,  you can purchase enhancement stims from the PvP vendor. Make sure you  use these as they can really make a difference in battle. Also, they are  on a different timer to PvE stimulants.</li></ul>That’s it, you are now ready to dominate Huttball.
