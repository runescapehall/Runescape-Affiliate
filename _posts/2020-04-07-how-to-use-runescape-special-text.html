<b>1. Intro</b><a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/null" name="intro"></a><br />Special texts are effects and colours you can add to a text in  runescape. However a text can’t be given any special effects in private  chat, but they’re very useful for selling stuff. You have different kind  of effects and different kinds of colours you can add to a text. Under  here you can see the effects and colours and how to make them.<br /><br />Colours:<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/null" name="colours"></a><br /><br /><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>Colour of the text</td><td>How to make the colour</td><td>Example Picture</td></tr><tr><td>Cyan text</td><td>cyan: (what you want to write)</td><td><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/cyan.png" /></td></tr><tr><td>Green text</td><td>green: (what you want to write)</td><td><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/green.png" /></td></tr><tr><td>Purple text</td><td>purple: (what you want to write) </td><td><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/purple.png" /></td></tr><tr><td>White text</td><td>white: (what you want to write)</td><td><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/white.png" /></td></tr><tr><td>Red text</td><td>red: (what you want to write)</td><td><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/red.png" /></td></tr><tr><td>Red and yellow flashing text</td><td>flash1: (what you want to write)</td><td><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/flash1.gif" /></td></tr><tr><td>Blue and cyan flashing text</td><td>flash2: (what you want to write)</td><td><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/flash2.gif" /></td></tr><tr><td>Green and cyan flashing text</td><td>flash3: (what you want to write)</td><td><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/flash3.gif" /></td></tr><tr><td>Red, yellow, green and cyan glowing text</td><td>glow1: (what you want to write)</td><td>none</td></tr><tr><td>Red, purple and blue glowing text</td><td>glow2: (what you want to write)</td><td>none</td></tr><tr><td>White, green and cyan glowing text</td><td>glow3: (what you want to write)</td><td>none</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Effects: <a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/null" name="effects"></a><br /><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>What kind of effect</td><td>How to make the effect</td><td>Example Picture</td></tr><tr><td>Up and down waving effect</td><td>wave: (what you want to write)</td><td><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/wave.png" /></td></tr><tr><td>From right to left waving effect</td><td>wave2: (what you want to write)</td><td><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/wave2.png" /></td></tr><tr><td>Shaking effect</td><td>shake: (what you want to write)</td><td><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/shake.png" /></td></tr><tr><td>Scrolling effect</td><td>scroll: (what you want to write)</td><td><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/scroll.png" /></td></tr><tr><td>Text sliding from above effect</td><td>slide: (what you want to write)</td><td>none</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><hr /><b>2. Combinations</b> <a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/null" name="combi"></a><br />You can also add an effect and a colour to a text. Then you always first  have to add the effect and then the colour. And between the effect and  the colour there always has to be a  :  else it won’t work. Under here I  will show you how to make combinations.<br /><br />Good combinations:<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/null" name="goodcombi"></a><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/good1.png" /><br /><br />cyan:shake: hello this works good<br /><br /><br />red:wave2: hello this is fun to do!!<br /><br />Bad combinations:<a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/5/null" name="badcombi"></a><br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/bad1.png" /><br /><br />This didn’t work as you can see I did cyanshake: but I had to do cyan:shake:.<br /><br /><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081220191321im_/http://www.runetower.com/Otherguides/Special Text/bad2.png" /><br /> This didn’t work as well as you can see. I managed to get the text wave2  but I wanted it in red so I had to do red:wave2: and not wave2:red:.
