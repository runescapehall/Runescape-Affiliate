Spying: Then, if you brought it, put on your stronger armour and walk to the end of the room. Push on the “odd looking wall.” Walk up to the grill and “listen” on grill. You will hear a meeting between a witch, a goblin, and a black knight. They are talking about an invisibility potion (secret weapon). Then leave through the “odd looking wall”.

Destruction: Back in the guard’s entrance, try to go through the second door in. The guard, if there currently is one, will tell you that the black knights are currently having a top secret meeting. You go in anyway. Now this is the some-what challenging part. By yourself or with a friend, all the black knights in the room need to be distracted for you to leave the room. When they are, leave through the southern door. Then go up the stairs and walk north to the “odd looking wall.” Push it and walk to the hole in the floor.
