Or if you’re bored of the big methods you can  try these out to keep your cash flow coming in.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div align="center">~ Snapegrass ~ </div><br />I  personally think snapegrass is a very good way to earn that quick buck.  Go to Waterbirth Island. Now pick the snape grass and then run to seers  and bank it. Snape grass is in pretty high demand because of prayer  pots, witch are in high demand because of pkers. {Lets all bow our heads  and take a moment of silence for the pkers that help us make money}.  You can sell snape grass for an amazing 350-500 ea. To maximize profits  find a good ol newb and tell him you will pay him 200 ea for every  hundred snap grass he collects you. This way if you get say 800 snape  grass an hour and he gets about 500 snape grass an hour that’s 420k an  hour selling the snape grass at 400 ea! Imagine having 2 or 3 newbs  working for you. Can you say super rich 3 times fast? Try it.  Superichesuperrichsuperich. Good job. <br /><br /><br /><div align="center">~ White Berries ~ </div><br />Another  Little but Effective way to earn the big cash is white berries. What  you want to do is bring a bad weapon with you and pull the leaver in  Ardy, to get to 55 wild. Now go west (correct me if im wrong) until you  see the white berries. You can get 900 ea for these. Once you get a full  inventory bank them in ardy. Once again you can get a newb friend to  help you get them. This time pay him 400 ea. He will think your God. If  you each get 600 ea an hour you will make upwards of 800k an hour. Nice  work that’s your new whip in 2.6 hours!<br /><br /><div align="center">~ Red Spider Eggs ~</div><br /><br />These  can be found in edgy duegeon. Go north past the thieves then you will  see them. They sell for 500 ea. It takes 5 minutes a trip. 28x500= 14k a  trip   14kx12= 168k+ a hour. May not be the best but its pretty easy.<br /><br /><div align="center">~ Chocolate Dust ~</div><br /><br />To  get chocolate bars you can go to narhada or if you did rfr you can get  them in the chest. Im pretty sure the bars sell for 12 gp ea. Once you  get your desired amount of bars use a pestle and motar to turn them into  dust. Chocolate dust sells for 250-400 gp ea. Ill warn you now, its not  the easiest to sell.<br /><br /><br /><br />3. <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 100%;"></span></span><br /><div align="center"><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 100%;">~ Getting Your First 300k ~ </span></span></div><span style="color: red;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 100%;"></span> </span> <br /><br /><br />So, to start out merchanting you need 300k minium. To get this you can do a few things. <br /><br /><div align="center">~ Nature/Law Run ~ </div><br /><br />This  is pretty simple. To Nat run you find a crafter who will pay 7-10k per  run or of course double nats. Then you bring your ess to him and he will  trade you 24 more ess plus the money. Note that somtimes you ahve to  bring your own essence. You run to the general store unnote the ess and  go again. Assuming your making 8k a run or double nats, witch is 14k a  run, and it takes 2 minutes a run, this will only take 74 minutes.  That’s 300k an hour within it self! If you do double nats its close to  400k. To law run bring the ess to entranta, to a law running world, and  trade the people your ess for laws. Laws go for 300-350 ea so your  making 200-250k for every 1k laws you do. <br />Overall rating- 9/10 <br /><br /><div align="center">~ Flax ~ </div><br /><br />Go  south of seers village until you see a flax field. It is right near  party petes. Pick that blue stuff,(flax) then when you get a full  inventory bank it. Now, a lot of people are going to tell you to spin it  so you can get 150-180 ea for a bow string. But you can pick about 2  inventories of flax in the time you can spin one inventory of  bowstrings. So you can make more money not spinning it. Get 3k flax and  then your ready. <br />Overall rating- 5/10 <br /><br /><div align="center">~ Eyes of Newts ~ </div><br />The  port sarim mage shops sells eyes of newts for 3 gp ea. Last time I  checked 1k eye of newts can go for about 250k. that’s a 247k profit  every 1k eye of newts you get. Do this one or two times and you will be  all set. This is pretty good money but can get boring at times. <br />Overall rating- 6/10 <br /><br />4. <span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 100%;"><span style="color: #000099;"></span></span><br /><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 100%;"><span style="color: #000099;">~ 300k-1m ~ </span></span></div><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 100%;"><span style="color: #000099;"></span> </span> <br />So,  you have 300k. Congratulations. I hope your not tired yet, because your  journey to hundred of mills had just begun! Now time for your first  milion. <br /><br /><br /><div align="center">~ Water Filled Vials~ </div><br /><br />Ok,  so your probably thinking I am crazy. Your thinking Oliver I am going  to make 700k off water filled vials??!?! Are you high?!?!? The answer to  both questions is yes. nahhh about the second one, but the first one is  yes you can. Go to East Ardy general store. Buy the water filled vials  for 12 ea. With 300k you can get 25k water filled vials. I aint that  crazy. im only asking you to get 5k of them. 5k water filled vials is  60k. You can sell for 200-250 ea. You’re making 1.1m profit in only  about 5 hours. You can do these all the way to 10m but if I were you, I  would stop here. <br />Overall rating- 8/10 <br /><br /><br /><div align="center">~ Water Runes/Fire Runes ~ </div><br /><br />If  you do this right, you can double your money every time. Go to the port  sarim rune shop and buy the water runes or fires until they hit 15 ea.  Then switch worlds and do it again. You can get about 25k-30k water  runes/fires. (this does not take as long as you think ). Then go on the  forums and sell these baby’s for 20 ea. if you got 25k you can sell for  500k. Keep repeating this as much as you want or until 1m. <br />Overall rating- 9/10 <br /><br /><div align="center">~ Bronze Arrows ~ </div><br /><br />Believe  it or not i made 11m off of these. What you want to do is go to the  arrow shop in varrock,catherby,or east ardy where you got the vials, and  buy them out, then switch worlds. They cost a max of 6ea so you can get  50k arrows. Now sell these on forums for 20 ea. Exactly 1m <br />Overall rating- 10/10<br /><br /><div align="center">~ Cooked Lobsters ~</div><br /><br />Go  to the fourms and buy these for 190-200 gp ea. Now make your way to  edgeville in a busy f2p pking world. Sell them for 230-250 ea. Pretty  nice profit if I dont say so myself.<br />Overall rating 6/10<br /><br /><br /><div align="center">~ Nature Runes ~</div><br />You  can buy these in Ali’s crate/mage wildy bank for 225 ea. For ali's  crate theres a guide on runehq. Sell them on the fourms for 330-350 ea.  Almost 100 gp profit per nat! I haven’t tried this yet but trust me it  sound fail-proof.<br />Overall rating-8/10<br /><br /><br />5. <span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 100%;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"></span></span><br /><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 100%;"><span style="color: #3366ff;">~ 1m - 5m ~ </span></span></div><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 100%;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"></span> </span> <br /><br />Yay  you have your first mill. DO NOT SPEND IT. Give yourself a pat on the  back, eat some milk and cookies and come back totally refreshed because  your about to make 5m. <br /><br />You can do any of the methods I had  above. Only this time you can do it in bulk. For example, you can buy  166k bronze arrows. You can sell these for 3.3m. even if you only do  100k that’s still 2m. Or u can do about 110k water runes. Now if your  bored of these listen to these methods. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div align="center">~ Pure Essence ~ </div><br />This  is one of my favorite methods. Go to a crowded p2p world in varrock  east and buy pure ess for 90 ea. You can get 11k. Then go and sell it  for 105-115 ea. I use to make 1m an hour doing this. <br />Overall rating- 7/10<br /><br /><div align="center">~ Cooked Lobsters ~</div><br /><br />This time you can buy 5k lobbies at 190 ea. Sell them for 250 ea and make 300k profit a flip.<br />Overall rating7/10<br /><br /><div align="center">~ Oak Logs ~</div><br /><br />Go  to varrock west bank in world 1. buy all the oaks you can for 25 ea. (  with 1m 40k oaks ). Now sell the oaks for 40 ea. 600k profit every mill  you spend. These aren’t the easiet thing to buy, but make a nice profit  if you can pull it off.<br />Overall Rating- 8/10<br /><br /><div align="center">~ Willow Logs ~</div><br /><br />Not  as much profit as oak, but easier to buy. Go to a f2p world with 1k+  people in it. Buy willows for 30 gp ea. Then go to the fourms and sell  them for 40 ea. Not as much profit, but I bet you can buy off to flips  of willows before you can do 1 flip of oaks. <br />Overall rating- 9/10<br /><br /><br /><div align="center">~ Oaks to Planks ~</div><br /><br />Do  the amount of money you have divided by 290. (1m is 3.4k) It costs 40  gp each oak log and 250 ea to make them into oak planks. Now put all  your money in your invo and withdraw 27 oaks. Go make them into planks a  little south of varrocks lumber yard. Now you can sell oak planks for  500 ea making a 210 profit a plank. This is really nice money.<br />Overall Rating-10/10<br /><br />With 1m you can start pot merching or unid merching, so look at the end of my guide for a pot and unid merchanting section.<br /><br />6. <span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 100%;"><span style="color: #660000;"></span></span><br /><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 100%;"><span style="color: #660000;">~5m-10m~</span></span></div><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 100%;"><span style="color: #660000;"></span></span><br /><br />Congratulations you finally have 5m. You should be proud of yourself, but you’re not done yet. <br /><br /><br />With  5m you can buy up to about 500k water runes. if you went that far you  can sell them for 10m but you really only need about 200k of them, sell  those for 4m making a 2.2m profit. <br /><br />With 5m you can also go to the forums and buy bronze arrows for 15 ea. Buy 300k of them. Sell for 20 ea. 1.5m a flip! <br /><br /><br /><br />~ Mage Arena ~ <br /><br />Go  to the mage arena in 55 wild. then withdraw your 5m from the bank.  World hop all the deaths and nats. You should at least be making 2-3m  profit every 5m u spend. <br />Overall rating- 8/10 <br /><br /><br /><br />~ Barrows ~ <br /><br />Which sets to buy/sell:<br /><br />The best sets to buy are ahrim, torag,dharok, verac, and guthans try to avoid karils unless its the bow. <br /><br />: How to buy the pieces: <br /><br />2 Options: <br /><br />1.  Go to fally park world 2 and find the barrows set you wish to merchant.  Sorry i have no accurate prices atm. And buy the sets or pieces for  100k-200k under priced and sell for 100k-200k more on the forums or in  fally. <br /><br />2. Make a thread on the forums entitling the fact that  your buying all barrows parts, put every piece 100k under priced and  then when you have a few items go to world 2 and sell and repeat.<br /><br /><br />if  you don’t feel comfortable with barrows ill tell you what i personally  did. i bought bronze arrows for 15 ea and sold for 20. by now u can flip  500k minimum every time. that’s a 2.5m profit a flip. aint to bad if i  don’t say so myself <br /><br />~ Ranger Set ~<br /><br />go to fally park world  2 and but a ranger set for 4.7m. now go to the fourms and sell it for  4.8-5m. a nice and easy profit with little to no effort.<br /><br />You can also look at the end of my guide to pot and unid merch.<br /><br />~ 10m+ ~ <br /><br /><br />By  now you can do a few things. You can stick with barrows, or you could  stick with buying bronze arrows in bulk. You can also go back to pure  ess. go to a crowded p2p world varrock east. with 10m you can flip 111k  pure ess buying at 90 ea. if you sell it for 110 ea u make 1.1m a flip  if u sell at 115 ea you make 1.6m a flip. you can also flip 10k unids.  by now id'in that much wouldn’t b worth it so u can sell for about 1.4k  ea. 4m profit a flip. if your bored of all of these, try my little but  effective methods.<br /><br />~ Furys ~<br /><br />Go to the fourms and buy 66k  chaos runes for 120 gp ea. ( 7.92m ). Now sell them to the toukull  place. When you done selling them you should be able to buy 2 onyx’s  from the shop. Now find a trusted free crafter to make them into fury’s.   . Now sell these fury’s for 4.8-5m ea. This method can literally make  millions a day.<br /><br /><br /><br />~ The secrets to phat merchanting~( and all other rares ) <br /><br />Now  if u notice phats and most other rares drop when a update comes that  takes money out of the game. 9 take barrows or construction for example  ). this is your time to pounce. Buy it when its few mill down. then wait  until prices go back to normal and always try to sell it at night (  when there worth the most ). remember always try to make the flip as  quick as possible. never invest unless you wont b playing for a little  while. i don’t suggest doing this with half wines, pumpkins, or disk of  returning. <br />~ A big secret ~ <br /><br />you need 5m+ to do this. ok when  an update comes after its done everything in all shops restocks to full  capacity. as soon as the updates over go straight to varrock rune shop,  pc rune shop, port sarim, mage arena, or mage guild. ( i suggest mage  arena or guild ). buy all the runes that you no can sell easily. then  world hop. keep on doing this. if you spend 5m you should make about  2-10m. <br /><br />~ Skills ~ <br /><br />skills can also make you pretty good money, sometimes even more then merchanting itself. <br /><br /><br />~ woodcutting ~ <br /><br />Once  you get woodcutting to 75 you can cut magic’s and yews. it takes me  about 20 minutes each load of magic’s and 10 minutes each load of yews.  if you cut magic’s thats about 60k an hour. You can also cut willows or  maples witch go really dang quick at 75 wc. Willows sell for 40 ea and  maples sell for 100 ea. not to bad, but its guaranteed money unlike  merchanting. The best place to get willows is near Draynor bank, maples  is south of rellaka, you will see a huge stash of them, yews is in seers  or behind varrock if your f2p, and for magic’s go to the mage training  arena and there’s 2 magic’s on either side, you can also go south of  seers. <br /><br /><br />~ fletching ~ <br /><br />ill put it plain and simple.  Your not going to profit in fletching until lvl 75 when you can do yew  longs. what you do is you buy yews for 250 ea and bowstrings for 150 ea.  then u make them into yew longs ( s ). you can sell these for 550k  making 150k a flip. you can make even more with mage longs. never alch  your bows unless your planning to cut your own logs. you will end up  losing cash. Ok I lied again. You can profit a little below 75. what you  do is you can buy regular logs for 30 ea ( hire a bunch of f2pers to  cut em ). Each regular log gives 15 arrows shafts. These sell for 150  ea. That’s 120 profit a log. This may not seem like a lot but if u hire  enough workers you can get about 3k a hour. That’s 360k a hour! <br /><br /><br />~ fishing ~ <br /><br />fishing  is good at lvl 68 and beyond, but could be profitable under that.  Reason being you can go into the fishing guild. this is good because its  a nicer environment but the stove and bank is right there. i don’t  really recommend catching sharks because they take so long. stick with  raw lobbies witch you can get about 250 ea for. not that bad considering  once you hit 68 they come in pretty quick. Swordies can sell for  250-300 ea. <br /><br />If you really really want to, you can do sharks. Sell them cooked in edgeville world 18 for 900-1k ea. <br /><br />~ Crafting ~ <br />Crafting  is very downplayed. Not a lot of people think of crafting as a good way  to make cash. For awhile I didn’t even think it was. But I was wrong.  First off to get to lvl 10 crafting so get about 300 cowhides. This is  jus a rough estimate. Now go get them all tanned into soft leather.  Everytime you can a new lvl craft a new thing that you could, from the  soft leather. Soon enough you should be lvl 10 crafting. At lvl 10 you  can spin bowstrings. Buy your flax for 90-100 ea and spin it. Sell the  bowstrings for 180-200 ea. You can also craft full dragon hide sets. I  have no clue how much hides you need for a set but green d hide sell for  about 1.5k ea, blue d hide is like 1.8k ea, red is around 2.5k ea and I  think black is 4k ea. A green full set sells for 25k, blue sells for  40-60k, red sells for 65-70k and black sells for a solid 50-60k. you can  also make rings with crafting. The most profitable ring to make is ring  of recoil. At edge world 18 these sell for 2k ea! Another way to make  cash with crafting is something I like to call battlestaving. You buy  battlestafs for zaf* for about 7k ea. World hop a lot of them. Now go  make glass orbs for as many battle staffs as you have. ( 50 battle  staffs= 50 orbs ). Now go to enchant the orb. I suggest water orbs, go  way way way back in travlery dungeon past the black demons and fire  obelisk. Then go up to that small island to change the orb. Alch the  battle staffs for 9.3k ea. <br /><br />~ Combat ~ <br />Once you get into the  higher combat lvls combat is really good for money. You can fight a few  things here. Green and Blue drags are awesome. Last time I checked green  hides can go for 1.5k each and drag bones are another 2.5k ea. That’s a  minimum of 4k a drop. Then you can get clue scrolls or pretty good drop  for alching. They also frequently drop coins. Im pretty sure blue hides  go for about 2k ea. <br /><br />correct me if I am wrong. That’s 4k a drop  every blue dragon you kill. Remember dragons have good mage defense so  use melee or range. If your using melees don’t forget your anti fire  shield and range anti fire pots. You can also go to the tazz***. These  drop obby items and tokull. If you get lucky here and get a good drop  then your in the big money. <br /><br /><br />~ Mining ~ <br /><br />Personally, i  think mining is really broing but you can still make money from it,  therefor its in this guide. Once you get to 45-50 mining you can one hit  iron ore, therefore this is where the money starts rollng, you can sell  iron ore for 100 ea. at 65 i reccamend mining coal. if you get alot of  coal you can sell it for 200-250 ea. and finally, if you have the  patience for 85 mining you can mine rune. what you do is mine the 2  rocks in the heros guild. Then world hop. the rock respawn is about 20  mins. you can make upwards of 300k doing this<br /><br /><br />~ Herb Merchanting ~<br />(All pics taken from runehq)<br /><br />In  this part of the guide ill tell you the secrets to organizing your  bank, buy and sell unids, and how to prevent scams. O yea I forgot, of  course ill also tell you, how to make millions. First off though I  suggest you at least start with 1m.<br /><br />First thing is first. Collect  about 500-1k unid herbs from monster drops. I suggest chaos druids, or  you can buy 11 stack herbs for 1k ea. Try to have atleast 20 unids in  each stack before you continue. Now order your herbs from least to  greatest like so.<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070112154313/http://imageshack.us/" target="_blank">[img=http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/1318/herbsortjq4.jpg]</a><br /><br />now  one by one take out each unid herb. DON’T MESS UP THE ORDER. Now bring  these to narada and get them ided for 250 gp ea. Now put them back in  your bank in the same order you took them out. NEVER remove the last  unid from the stacks or else it will stink up the order. Now that your  unids are in order and you no witch unid is witch you can finally start  to merchant.<br /><br />Only buy unids in notes. This makes it so you can  buy a lot at one time. Buy them for 1k-1.3k ea depending on how even  there stacks are and how many they have. Never buy one stack 500, one  stack 600, and the other stacks 30 or 40.  always use a calculator  because if you add with your head, theres to much room for error.<br /><br />Now  you can have few options. Here are the most popular. You can but 11  stack unids and then when you have a lot sell them for 1.5k-1.7k ea. You  can buy unids above ranarr, one unid at a time, or unids above harra.  When your buying one unids at a time, unids above harra, or unids above  ranarr withdraw one of each unids your buying in note form. Then fill  the rest of your inventory with junk, like essence, like so.<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070112154313/http://imageshack.us/" target="_blank">[img=http://img268.imageshack.us/img268/8042/newherbbuyingko2.jpg]</a><br /><br />this  way if the kid is trying to jipp you and puts in unids that your not  buying it will say you don’t have enough invo space. Now you can sell  your unids, or get the better ones, ranarr and above, id’ed in Narda and  sell them separately identified. <br /><br />I've been doing herblore  merchanting for quite awhile. It's not the market it used to be. There's  lotsa scamming and price gouging (yes, I'm guilty of the later). Still,  I've been able to raise my herblore skill by buying unids, id'ing what I  can, making easy to sell potions, then selling everything. I'm now 69  herblore which means I don't have to sell unid herbs if I don't want to.  <br /><br />You decide for yourself how to approach the merchanting. You  determine the price you will pay and you will sell. The buyer will  decide if he'll do business with you. Being called a noob or a moron  cause you have your own price should be irrelevant. However, be firm but  reasonable. Adapt to the selling, buying and the market. Above all have  fun.<br /><br /><br />~ You Be The Boss ~<br /><br />Have you ever wanted to  start your own business but weren’t sure what to do? Well now im here to  tell you step by step what to do.<br /><br />First you’re going to want to  decide on a business name. Don’t put something like yournamehere co.  everyone uses that. Your going to want to do something that people will  remember. The more creative your name is the more people are going to  remember you.<br /><br />Now you have to choose something you want your  business to be based on. I recommend logs or ores as these are the  easiest. You can also give runes a shot if you want to. Whatever you do  remember to always study the market price and get a good price range.<br /><br />When  your going to hire workers make sure they are loyal and they can meet a  certain quota every week. For example, if your making a log business  and they are cutting willows logs, make sure they get a certain number  of logs every week.<br /><br />When your paying your workers pay them 20-50  gp below market price. You may be saying holy crap Oliver I wont be  making any profit. Well your wrong there for 2 reasons.  First off, if  your paying to low, no one will want to work for you. Second you should  be starting with atleast 5m so you can buy in bulk. For example if your  buying willows for 30 gp ea you can buy 166k willows off your workers.  When you sell them you’ll make a 1.6m profit.<br /><br />Just remember stick to your prices and hire the right workers, and you can make a ton of money off running a good business.<br /><br /><br />~ Pking ~<br />( quests list and equipment list for ohnoyouvbeenpked guide )<br /><br />Pking  is a good money maker and you can have a lot of fun doing it. Im going  to tell you step by step how to develop a range pure.<br /><br />For the range pure there are a few pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros-  Fun to pk with. They are pretty cheap only costing you 2-3m. they are also pretty easy to handle.<br /><br />Cons- they are pretty damn boring to train.<br /><br />Now  that the new prayers are out, you will have to make a decision. Do you  want more k0 power or higher hp. If you want more k0 power get 44/52  prayer. If you want the most hp keep 1 prayer. A basic ranger has 75+  range, 65+ hp, 45 mage, 1-52 prayer. If I were you I wouldn’t pk until  55+ combat or else you wont get jack crap. If your serious about it go  until 75+ range. <br /><br />Of course your going to need to do some quest. I will list them here.<br /><br />1.)  Waterfall Quest: Probably one of the easy quests and quick 30 atk and  str to start with. Even though your not a melee, you may change your  mind some point.<br /><br />2.) Dwarf Cannon: This is a MUST. You need this  or it is impossible now to beat Desert Treasure if you want to be an  Ancients Ranger. You need a cannon to defeat every boss now because  Jagex has changed it so a friend cannot block a boss for you.<br /><br />3.) Death Plateau: This is another attack booster without doing much trainning like waterfall. <br /><br />4.)  Priest in Peril: This is if you want to start an ancients ranger or  just get prayer. This can also be beneficial, as you have access to  Experiments (Level 25, 100 HP).<br /><br />5.) Desert Treasure: Complete all  the required quests and this can give you access to Ancient Magicks.  Pking with this list of magic is quite effective, as you can bind  players in place and also do damage at the same time. This can also be a  great final blow when pking another pure or player. If you are  ancienting, I highly suggest getting 70+ magic. Ice Burst and Ice  Barrage are the most common spells used.<br /><br />6.)Biohazard: This quest  is optional, if you want to power train on ogres to avoid pest control  that's fine. This technique involves less activity, in case if you want  surf the forums or read a book while trainning.<br /><br />7.) Recipe for  Diaster: This is not a required quest to be a good ranger. Most just get  this out of the way incase they want to train melee and still be ranged  based, or just get melee.<br /><br />8.) Rolving Elves: This quest is  optional incase if you want the crystal bow. In that case, you must  train your agility at least to 52 (use agility pots if not 56). Crystal  bows are quite fun and useful in Pest Control.<br /><br />For training  you’re going to need 50k+ arrows or knifes. (200k+ if you’re planning to  power range). An ammy of glory or a fury, Coif or robin, and if you  want robin boots and obby cape. <br /><br />1-15 range- to start off I suggest training on the cows near alkarid.<br /><br />15-40  range- Next place to train is the dwarf mine near Falador. Bring food  and arrows. Attack scorpions (level 14) until maybe 30 range. Then you  can beat King Scorpions (level 32) in there as well. There are many  rocks to hide behind from and they cant hit very high.<br /><br />40-60 range- Now you should train on rock crabs. Bring a lot of lobsters tely runes and plenty of iron knifes or arrows.<br /><br />60-70  range- I suggest training on ogres in lathas training ground. Depending  on how many arrows you have you can power range them or pick up your  arrows.<br /><br />70+ range- you can finally go to PC. Take bronze or iron  arrows. When your picking up it takes about 1.5k iron arrows to grow a  lvl. Next thing is always try to find a fresh world and don’t use 78.  About every 300 point you sue on range you 100 on hp. This way your hp  isn’t super low. If you don’t do this, your asking to get k0’ed.<br /><br />Finally  your ready to pk. You’ve been itching to ever since you started your  pure now you finally could. When your pking on a normal ranger ( no  ancients ) your going to want to bring Coif<br />Leather Body<br />Black Dragonhide Chaps<br />Black Dragonhide Vambs<br />Magic Shortbow<br />50 x Rune Arrows or 100 x Rune Arrows if you don't want to pick up.<br />Amulet of Power or Amulet of Glory<br />Ring of Recoil<br /><br />In your inventory bring 1 range pot , 1 anti poison, 2 rings of recoil,  24 sharks, and if you have prayer 1 or 2 prayer pots.<br /><br />When  your fighting basically watch your and your opponents hp. Special when  they have half to a lil lower then half hp. If they are daggering you  eat once then special, since they don’t eat when there daggering. That  should bring in a nice k0.<br /><br />For your ancient ranger this is what you should wear. <br /><br />Ghostly Hood/Gnome Hat/Canifis Hat<br />Amulet of Power/Glory<br />Ghostly Robe Top<br />Ghostly Robe Bottom/Black Dragonhide Chaps (if your more range)<br />Ghostly Boots<br />Magic Shortbow<br />Ghostly Gloves<br />Ghostly Cape/God Cape<br />50 x Rune Arrows or 100 if you don't want to pick up.<br />Ring of Recoil<br /><br />In  your inventory have 1 range pot, an anti, a ring or recoil, 22 sharks,  if your using ice burst have 50 deaths, 100 water, and 100 chaos. If  your using ice barrage have 50 bloods, 100 deaths, and 150 waters. Both  of these runes are good for 25 casts.<br /><br />When your pking first find a  pure. Then burst or barrage him, then start ranging the crap out of  him. Then special like you would on a regular ranger then burst or  barrage and hope you hit to finish him. If he doesn’t die eat and get  ready for another round until you get your special back.<br /><br /><br />~ Pot Merching ~<br /><br />The  find art of pot merchanting. Potions are some of my favorite thing to  merch mainly because the prices are fairly stable except for prayer  pots. Start with 1m+ and a ton of patience, and you will pretty much  guaranteed to get rich off this. Also remember to always use 3 dose pots  as they are easier to work with.<br /><br />Before we start lets go over the places to buy and sell pots. To buy pots you can use the forums or this part of fally world 2.<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070112154313/http://imageshack.us/" target="_blank">[img=http://img192.imageshack.us/img192/1678/spottomerchih4.png]</a><br /><br />to sell pots always use edgeville world 18. now on to the marching part.<br /><br />1-7m<br /><br />I  suggest buying 333 range pots for 3k ea. In edgy range pots can easily  be sold for 4-5k ea. They aren’t the easiest sell and this will probably  take u 1-2 days but they yield a very good profit.<br /><br />You can also  use super strengths witch are pretty easy to merch. On the forums you  will find people selling them 3.5k-4k ea. In edgy world 18 sell them for  5k ea. <br /><br />A good tip is find someone who’s training their herblore  and will be making a lot of the pots your buying. I was lucky enough to  find hawl gunn ranked number one in herblore. They can be permitant  sellers and will give you a fairly cheap price since they are selling in  bulk.<br /><br />7-15m<br /><br />At around 5m you should expand you’re your  stockpile to include super sets and other pots but remember to always  keep ranges and sup strengths on hand. This way if your selling range  pots and you see someone buying 50 super sets you can go to them to make  that little extra profit. Now I will tell you the secret to buying  cheap super sets. Buy super strengths for 3.5k-4k ea. Buy super attacks  for 1k each and super defenses for 2k ea. This will cost you about 7k a  set. You can sell super sets in world 18 for 10k each making an amazing  3k profit a set. If you stick with it super sets and make you an amazing  amount of moola.<br /><br />15m+<br /><br />this is where the money is going to  start to flow and where you’ll be making the serious cash. The trick is  to keep a wide of variety of pots in your stock pile and to buy pots in  bulk as cheap as possible.  Remember to always carry a lot of super  sets and prayer pots as these are the most sought after pots, but always  keep range and mage so you can always be making sales, and you’re not a  sitting duck. If your selling on the forums to get more buyers try and  give a bulk discount. For example say selling 1k super set 9k ea or 500+  8.5k ea. ( since you have so much bulk you don’t have to sell at top  price, and you’ll still make a good profit.<br /><br /><br /><br />~ Conclusion ~<br /><br />The  guide has finally come to a finish, but your money making journey is  not over. Keep on buying and selling what works for you and keep on  going. When you get enough money invest in a few phats and rares. Trust  me stick with this guide and you will have that phat set you’ve always  wanted and more.
