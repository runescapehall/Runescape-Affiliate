Of course you have been curious and tried training on  them. It's really good experience. Although those monsters look weak,  they can kill you really fast.<br /><br /><div align="center"><u><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 100%;">Requirements</span></b></u></div><br /><br />The first thing to train there is to finish <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061030114252/http://www.zybez.net/quests.php?id=27" target="_blank">Horror from the deep</a> quest.<br />At least 65 attack, defence, strength.<br />Good armor.<br /><br /><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 100%;"><u><b>What should I take?</b></u></span></div><br /><br />Dagannoths  are monsters that are actually easy to kill with high levels and good  outfit for training. They use range based melee attack. Here are some  good outfit recommendations:<ul><li><b>Helmets</b> - Berserker helmet (  2nd option Rune full helmet ) - Berserker helmet gives some good  bonuses, with strength bonus that can help you a lot.</li><li><b>Amulets</b> - Fury amulet ( 2nd option Glory amulet ) - It's the best bonus giving  amulets, defence and attack bonuses which are really needed.</li><li><b>Plate legs/bodies</b> - Torag plate legs and body ( 2nd option Rune plate legs (skirt) and  body, Granite legs ) - Torag is the best defence bonuses giving armor,  2nd option is rune, which isn't so weak too. Also you can use granite  legs, which have great ranged bonus.</li><li><b>Capes</b> - Fire cape ( 2nd options - Obsidian, Legends cape ) - Fire cape is the best cape in the whole game, including strength bonus.</li><li><b>Rings</b> - Berserker/Warrior ring ( 2nd options - Ring of wealth/Ring of life ) -  Berserker is a good ring with strength bonus, if you want to kill  monsters fast. Warrior ring gives attack bonuses, which can be useful  with high strength.</li><li><b>Boots</b> - Climbing boots ( 2nd option - Rune boots ) - Climbing boots are cheap and better than rune. They also give strength bonus.</li><li><b>Weapons</b> - Abyssal whip ( 2nd option - Dragon longsword, Dragon scimitar ) -  Abyssal whip is the fastest weapon, it's also pretty strong.</li><li><b>Shields</b> - Toktz-Ket-Xil ( 2nd options - Granite shield, Rune defender, Dragon  square shield, Rune kite shield ) - Although Rune defender gives better  attack bonuses, Toktz-Ket-Xil shield gives more ranged defence bonus  which is more useful. Granite shield is very useful, but doesn't give  any strength bonus.</li><li><b>Gloves</b> - Dark (Barrows ) gloves ( 2nd  options - Armored gloves, Gauntlets ) - Dark ( Barrows ) gloves are the  best bonus giving gloves.</li></ul>2nd option are for the people who can't afford the best items to wear.<br /><br />There are 3 main options how to heal yourself if you get hurt:<ul><li>Use guthan set for healing - See prices from <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061030114252/http://www.zybez.net/priceguide.php?search_terms=Guthan&amp;search_area=1&amp;price_low=&amp;price_high=&amp;member=1" target="_blank">here.</a></i></li><li>Use bones to peaches spell - More information from <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061030114252/http://www.zybez.net/minigames.php?id=9" target="_blank">here.</a></i></li><li>Bring  noted food, un-note at shop - Bring noted food and also some cash with  you, if you're out of food, go to the 2nd floor of the Lighthouse. Sell  your noted food, and buy it back.</li></ul><div align="center"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 100%;"><b><u>Tips</u></b></span></div><br /><br />To  get experience a lot faster you can use (super) attack, (super) defence  and (super) strength potions. This will help you hitting higher, more  often and help you defending more. Good idea is to take about 10-20 sets  of potions as note. But also you'll need cash to un-note them at  Lighthouses second floor shop. To get ranged experience too while  training there, take a cannon. The Lighthouse basement is multiattack  zone and it will help you a lot.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 100%;"><div align="center"><b><u>FAQ</u></b></div></span><br /><br />Q: How can I get there?<br />A: There are two options, as shown on the map: ( On the blue line, you'll need to use agility )<br /><br /><img alt="IPB Image" border="0" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20061030114252im_/http://img484.imageshack.us/img484/9384/map10xg.png" />
