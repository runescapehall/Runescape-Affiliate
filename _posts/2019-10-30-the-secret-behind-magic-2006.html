This guide will explain to you some aspects about magic that are not  widely known. You all should know the basics of magic, so I'm not going  to cover the basics. If you don't know the basics there's tons of guides  out there explaining the basics. <br /><br />I'd recommend reading Zybez's magic guide if you're not familiar with magic, which can be found here:<br /><br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070111151121/http://www.zybez.net/skills.php?id=12" target="_blank">http://www.zybez.net/skills.php?id=12</a><br /><br />This guide will reveal what expert Pkers/Cw Legends do NOT want you to know. <br /><br />NOTE:  Please Disregard my lack of pictures. Since I'm not a member anymore,  taking pictures is very hard. Any donations would be helpful. <br /><br /><div align="center"><span style="color: grey;"><strike>__________________________________________________________________________</strike></span></div><br /><br /><span style="color: goldenrod;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 100%;"><b>2.0 - The Secret</b></span></span><br /><br />Magic is magic. It relates to A LOT of stuff. Now here are some pointers that I will make clear: <br /><br />In  RSC, if you “failed” a magic spell, you could not cast a magic spell  for twenty seconds. When RS2 was released, a failed spell just resulted  as a splash. <br /><br />How often you fail a spell is affected by your magic attack bonus, and your opponent's magic defense bonus. <br /><br />Here is what you probably don’t know: <br /><br />How often you fail a spell is also affected by your magic level AND your opponent's magic level. <br /><br />How often you fail a spell is also affected by your opponent's DEFENSE level.<br /><br />Now, you may already know this, but most of you don't know how it works. <br /><br />It's  easy. The gist is that the higher magic level you have, the lower the  probability of failing a spell will be. Defense also plays a role, but  little compared to that of magic. In this guide I will prove my theory  about magic and show you how to get the upperhand. Now, let me provide  some evidence.<br /><br /><div align="center"><span style="color: grey;"><strike>__________________________________________________________________________</strike></span></div><br /><br /><span style="color: goldenrod;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 100%;"><b>3.0 - Evidence</b></span></span><br /><br /><span style="color: #330033;"><b>A. Quote from Jagex </b></span><br /><br />Let's first relate this evidence to the Jagex manual itself. <br />This is stated from the official magic basics in the runescape manual section itself: <br /><br /><div align="center">(IMG:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070111151121/http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o188/Prodigy_x/ssss-1.jpg" target="_blank">http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o188/Prodigy_x/ssss-1.jpg</a>) </div><br /><br />“When  you cast combat related spells, there is a chance of you failing. This  is dependant on a few factors such as your magical attack bonuses, the  magical defence bonuses of your opponent and your magic experience.” <br /><br />Hmm;  let's look at this. Notice when it said “opponent AND your MAGIC  EXPERIENCE.” Wow. This evidence was clearly given in the runescape  manual itself. So why do people not know this? It's because a lot of  people just skim through the manual or don't even read it; even if they  read it through they don't interpret carefully. <br /><br />This is evidence  from the official site. Thus, let's continue to investigate that your  magic level is dependent on how often you fail a spell. <br /><br /><br /><b><span style="color: #330099;">B. Barrows </span></b><br /><br /><div align="center">(IMG:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070111151121/http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o188/Prodigy_x/barr.jpg" target="_blank">http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o188/Prodigy_x/barr.jpg</a>) </div><br /><br />(Note: This picture was taken from the Zybez Barrows Guide, which can be found here: <br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070111151121/http://www.zybez.net/minigames.php?id=2)" target="_blank">http://www.zybez.net/minigames.php?id=2)</a><br /><br />A  lot of people refer to barrows. Sure, barrows has great rewards, great  risks, all of that stuff; let's talk about slayer dart. Many people do  barrows with slayer dart, and even they mage in melee armour. But a  hypothesis was brought up saying that magic dart is not affected by  magic bonus. <br /><br />How is magic dart not affected? It is a magic  spell, right? Jagex said NOTHING about ANY magic spell not being  affected by “magic bonus.” In fact, here's a picture of slayer dart in  the magic database. <br /><br />Does it say anything about the slayer dart  having no effect from magic bonus? I think not, and even if they did say  that, the other spells would have the same effect also. <br /><br /><div align="center">(IMG:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070111151121/http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o188/Prodigy_x/sssss.jpg" target="_blank">http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o188/Prodigy_x/sssss.jpg</a>) </div><br /><br />Now lets go back to that quote again: <br /><br />“When  you cast combat related spells, there is a chance of you failing. This  is dependant on a few factors such as your magical attack bonuses, the  magical defence bonuses of your opponent and your magic experience.” <br /><br />Secondly,  magic dart is clearly stated in the knowledge base as a magic spell. So  what does this prove? Magic dart is a “common” magic spell, which has  rules stated above. <br /><br />Now then, why can people mage the brothers  with little magic attack bonus? Only one theory is left. The magic  brother's magic level is extremely low, and your magic level affects how  often you fail a spell. For example, you go into barrows with full  torags, and mage karil. Your magic level is 80+, and you only fail one  spell. This means, that your magic level and your opponent’s magic  level—in this case your opponent's magic level is much lower than  yours—play a role in the battle. <br /><br />This also brings up a lot of other stuff. More of this will be discussed in the later section referring to barrows. <br /><br /><br /><b><span style="color: #330099;">C. Castle Wars</span></b><br /><br />I will give you a list of “items”:<br /><br />Have  you ever failed a magic spell on someone with melee armour when you're  wearing full mystic? If so, it was probably on a high leveled guy. And  chances are, if you follow him, he'll switch to his robes and start  blitzing/barraging other people. This is only because his magic level is  higher than yours and thus he has a higher resistance to your spells. <br /><br />Have  you ever seen a person barrage you in full dragon? In a lot of cases,  yes. Even if you're wearing dhide, you STILL get barraged by a person in  full melee armour! How is this? It's because his magic level is way  higher than yours, and he has a pretty good chance of hitting you with  barrage. <br /><br />Second, have you ever been anciented constantly with  karil's armour on? Yes karil’s is the best magic-defense armour in the  game, but how can this be? Only because your opponent’s magic level is  higher than yours. Ask the experts who barrage like this. They'll be  blindfolded that you actually found out the truth. <br /><br />All of this  is REAL-TIME evidence. I've basically experienced all of these, and if  you go up and talk to one of those magers on the walls, they probably  have experienced it too. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><span style="color: grey;"><strike>__________________________________________________________________________</strike></span></div><br /><br /><span style="color: goldenrod;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 100%;"><b>4.0 - How it Relates to What We Do</b></span></span><br /><br /><b><span style="color: #330099;">A. Barrows</span></b><br /><br />Ok, so now you know the truth behind magic dart. <br /><br />Many people ancient and use wave spells with full magic-boosting armour. This is not necessary, because of the theory stated. <br /><br />As  a result, you CAN ancient and use wave spells with melee armour IF your  magic level is around 75 or more. Even 70-75 will work. The fact is,  that doing this is totally acceptable, since magic dart will have the  same result as these spells. <br /><br />Here’s an example: <br /><br />A person  I know with 99 magic experimented with me in this theory. He maged all  the brothers with a –54 magic bonus, and guess what? He diddn’t fail any  of the spells on the barrow melee brothers WITH ALL THREE types of  spells (Ancient, modern, Slayer Dart). Also, he only failed one or two  spells on karil and ahrim. <br /><br />For karil: Karil, yes, has the best  magic-defense armour in the game, but his magic level is very low. Thus,  if your magic level is much higher than his (In most cases, yes),  you'll have no problem, basically. <br /><br />Ahrim: Most of you do or see  people mage ahrim with no prayer. This is because they actually do have a  high magic and ranged level. I'd recommend you start doing this without  prayer if you have over 75 magic. In fact, with karils, I survived  ahrim with no problem with 70 mage back in the days.<br /><br /><br /><b><span style="color: #330099;">B. Pking</span></b><br /><br /><div align="center">(IMG:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070111151121/http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o188/Prodigy_x/sdfsdf.jpg" target="_blank">http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o188/Prodigy_x/sdfsdf.jpg</a>) </div><br /><br />A  while ago, Jagex released new prayers increasing your magic level by a  certain amount. The strongest of the three prayers, called Mystic Might,  increases your magic level by 15%. What Jagex said was that this spell  increased your chances of successfully hitting your opponent. However,  they said little about how it works defensively. <br />The new prayer can  also help defensively. When you are escaping, just turn on the prayer,  and you WILL have a higher chance of your opponent failing on you. <br /><br />The  new prayer also deteriorated the use of magic bonus armour. With the  new prayer, you can now, mage with less magic attack bonus. <br /><br />The  next tip I will give to you is to MAXIMIZE your magic level. Even if  it's 74 to 76, it's at least some difference.  And if your combat level  is not magic-based, you really should raise it as high as possible to  gain the advantage. Believe me, that's why all the famous pkers have  their magic level at the top. For instance, I_mahatma_I has 99 magic.  Why doesn't he just be lazy and have 94 or 96? Yeah, because. <br /><br /><br /><b><span style="color: #330099;">C. Castle Wars</span></b><br /><br />Castle  Wars. In my opinion, this is the most brilliant thing Jagex put into  the game. When it first came out, I instantly started playing it lots. <br /><br />First, let's analyze how the magic level theory affects the game: <br /><br />Many  people with a high magic level dominate in a certain way. Such include  powering the ancients, or just casting spells. A person ancienting with  70 magic may fail a ton of spells on a person with 90+ magic and +0-15  magic defense bonus. <br /><br />This is why you CAN ancient others easily  if you have a high magic level. Having a high magic level is also  dependent on how you resist spells. <br />For instance, if you have 80+ magic, you can mage with d-hide, and still do fine. <br /><br />Now let's talk about certain situations:<br /><br />If  you're being chased by an ancienter, put the Magic prayer ON. Once I  had this prayer on with karils and a barrager failed his spells about 10  times on me. It’s so easy. You can also put the prayer on in basically  any situation in which you need defense from magic. <br /><br />If you're  trying to chase somebody that you know doesn't have a high magic level,  it's ok not to switch to your “mage-gear.” You may have to switch one  piece here and their, but if it's worth wasting time, don't do it. <br /><br />If  you're maging on the walls, go for the lower levels. Chances are,  you’ll have a higher chance of gaining more exp. Obviously, if a high  level has the flag, you should mage him though. <br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><span style="color: grey;"><strike>__________________________________________________________________________</strike></span></div><br /><br /><span style="color: goldenrod;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 100%;"><b>5.0 - Bonus Guide - 10 Mill in 10 Minutes?</b></span></span><br /><br />A  lot of "pay" guides mention how to earn 10 Mill in 10 minutes. To tell  the truth, there is NO consistent method known today that earns you 10  Mill in 10 minutes. Not even the best businessmen have achieved this. So  what do guides do to back this "10 Mill" theory up? <br /><br />It goes  simply like this. It's called "System Update." Whenever Jagex updates,  all of the runes restock, including that of the mage guild. It's  original stock is 5000, even though 250 is the max restock. Whenever  there is an update, you buy the runes, sell, and ect. <br /><br />Now, let's  refer to how the guides do it. They might say "3-10 Mill in 10  minutes!" However, the most likely case is that you will get three Mill  because that's how business goes. <br /><br />Sure 3 M in a week is good,  but there are some drawbacks. A TON of people already know this  "secret," so every world is probably filled up. Even if you manage to  get a head start, chances are, that there will be someone competing with  you 20 seconds after. Thus, this method is not really effective  anymore. <br /><br />In conclusion, there is no way of making "10 mill in 10 minutes" consistently without breaking the rules. <br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><span style="color: grey;"><strike>__________________________________________________________________________</strike></span></div><br /><br /><br /><span style="color: goldenrod;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 100%;"><b>6.0 - Conclusion + Q and A</b></span></span><br /><br />There you have it. I hope you enjoyed this guide, and I also hope that you use these theories to the best of your advantage. <br /><br />I'd  like to thank Cyrax for encouraging me to create this guide. I'd also  like to thank the people who have given me criticism and ratings on this  guide, and last but not least, I'd like to give a special thanks to all  of the people who have read this guide. Thank you. <br /><br />About me: <br />I’ve  decided to take a break from runescape. Now, my addiction is on other  things, not runescape (I hope that’s a good thing). I’ve probably done  over 1500 barrows trips with “normal-luck,” and I also have over 1500  castle wars tickets. <br /><br /><b><span style="color: #330099;">Q and A</span></b><br /><br /><span style="color: red;">Q.</span> You said something about defense also, can you explain that further?<br />A.  Yes. Paul Gower, upon release of Rs2, said that the success of your  magic spell depends on your combat skills on 80% of you and your  opponent's magic level, and 20% on your opponent's defense level. I  think defense IS important, but considering the fact that so many people  do not like raising defense, I've decided to wave off the defense part  of this guide. <br /><br /><span style="color: red;">Q.</span> This guide needs more pictures from what you are doing!<br />A.  Yes it does, but as I said, I'm not a member anymore, so I cannot get  that many pictures. But if you'd like to donate a helpful picture that  pertains to the guide, it would be awesome. <br /><br /><span style="color: red;">Q.</span> You just revealed the secret magic guide! Now even more people will  know this. And plus, when I go on the servers, I barely see anyone  there.<br />A. It doesn't matter. That's life. My friends and I have all  tried this trick, and we've all seen other people competing with us at  that same time. <br /><br /><span style="color: red;">Q.</span> Could you give me some tips to help me raise my magic level? <br />A.  Well, I really can't because the purpose of this guide is to really  prove some points in magic. But I highly recommend looking at Zybez's  magic guide because it does include tips on raising magic. The Guide can  be found here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070111151121/http://www.zybez.net/skills.php?id=12" target="_blank">http://www.zybez.net/skills.php?id=12</a><br /><br /><span style="color: red;">Q.</span> Do the magic prayers increase your magic in a way in which you can cast spells higher than your natural magic level? <br />A.  No. The prayers do not "naturally" increase your magic level, unlike  potions. Think of it as a similar prayer to the attack prayers. The  attack prayers boost your attack level, but do not help you wield other  weapons that require a higher attack level than your natural one. <br /><br /><span style="color: red;">Q.</span> Hey, it looks like you could help me a lot on this! Could you help me live in-game?<br />A.  Sure, feel free to give me a PM on anything that ranges from criticism  to questions, and I'll be more than glad to help. (Note that I do not go  on much these days)
