(MMO) Many new players are unfamiliar with the play style, and unintentionally create their first characters  on PvP server. As a result they may set themselves up for a shock when another player attacks them. Afterwards they find  themselves upset, confused or helpless.<br />This guide should help de-mystify PvP for new players. And, perhaps even help those players who had never considered PvP  because they had a bad experience or had just heard too many negative stories about the play style. PvP can be a fun and  rewarding experience with the right knowledge and attitude.<br /><h2 class="wheader" id="Getting_Started">Getting Started</h2><h3 class="wheader" id="Expectations_at_low_levels">Expectations at low levels</h3>The  most important thing one must be aware of when they start out on a PvP  server is that you are going to die. And you are going to die a lot.  From level 1 - 9 you are immune to PvP attacks. This beginning cushion  can throw people off because typically they are in the middle of no  where when they hit level 10 and immediately become flagged attackable.  And, in high traffic areas such as popular questing zones, outside city  walls, etc. be prepared to be attacked before the Level Up announcement  disappears from the screen.<br />New players who are still learning the  game, and even veteran players who are adapting to a PvP play style  need to keep something in mind. You're not going to win every fight. In  fact, you're likely to lose most of them. But, learn from each fight.  Study your opponents and eventually, if you are able to stick it out,  you'll become a formidable opponent.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Making_Money">Making Money</h3>Making money on the PvP servers is very similar to doing the same on the PvE servers. It just takes a little more finesse.<br /><b>Harvest:</b> Harvest everything in sight during your level 1-9 immunity stretch and  sell it on the broker. Personally, my bank box was up to 12 platinum  coins before I hit level 12 by ignoring quests and just harvesting.  Saving the rares I needed for my equipment and spells had me equipped at  T3 (Level 22) as soon as I dinged.<br /><b>Treasured Loot Drops:</b>  Don't attune every piece of equipment that drops! There are Transmuters  who are paying crazy prices on the broker for Treasured Items. And, in  most cases, the Master Crafted items you'll be equipping at level 22 are  going to be comparable to what you'll be tossing out from a loot drop  in 5 levels.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Questing_Tips">Questing Tips</h3>One  of the worst habits a player can make on a PvP server while questing is  to follow the beginning quest lines. People look for easy kills in high  traffic areas. The Graveyard in Freeport, the fields outside Antonica,  Darklight Wood and other new player harvesting grounds for people  looking for easy kills.<br />Get off the beaten path. If you are  familiar with EQ2, then avoid the temptation to take those linear quest  lines once you hit level 10. The enemy is in your territory waiting for  you to show up predictably. So, go to their territory and do your  questing. The safest place for me to quest on my alt characters as an  Evil player has been Greater Faydark and outside Antonica. All the  Qyenosians are in the Commonlands, Darklight Woods and Timerous Deep  looking for victims. The only hostiles I encounter on enemy soil are  other new players who are much more evenly equipped and probably just as  confused as a new player or at least new to PvP.<br /><h2 class="wheader" id="The_Basics">The Basics</h2><h3 class="wheader" id="PvP_Servers">PvP Servers</h3>There are currently three (3) PvP servers available when you create a new character. Your choice of server is <b>very</b> important and will dictate the experience you will have as a new PvP player.<br />Note:  At some yet unannounced time the Venekor and Nagafen servers will be  merged. This is a great opportunity to create a character on Venekor and  level it up with little distraction due to the low population. The  other option is to roll a character on Nagafen right away if you want to  avoid the "culture shock" later on.<br /><b>Nagafen:</b> One of the  most populated servers in EQ2. While many new players immediately pick  the highest populated server in anticipation of more groups, better  raiding and more friends; On a PvP server one must remember that means  more enemies around every corner. For non-stop PvP action, Nagafen is an  excellent choice. But, for those who are looking to level peacefully or  any other non-agressive activity. Keep in mind activities like  harvesting, questing and travel are going to take quite a bit more time  as there are very few places that won't be occupied with people looking  for a fight. Regardless of what you're agenda is.<br /><b>Venekor:</b>  The Venekor server was originally designated the Role Playing (RP)  server with PvP. However, over the years, the aspect of Role Play has  diminished to a few guilds and some players here and there. It is also  one of the most lightly populated servers in EQ2. This is not  necessarily a bad thing. Especially for somebody who is just "getting  their feet wet" with PvP. Easier to travel, harvest and quest  unmolested. But, when confronted by the enemy all the same PvP rules  apply. So, PvP is available and one must still be on their toes. But,  your opportunities to enjoy the risk and challenge of a PvP server  without having to fight every five minutes makes for a very casual and  enjoyable PvP experience for the player brand new to the PvP play style.<br /><b>Vox:</b> The Live Gamer, PvP server. Items and characters can be purchased for  real life cash. The most important thing to remember about this server  is that once you roll a character on it, or transfer to it, your  character can never leave it. The PvP activity is similar to Venekor in  casual play. However, its important to remember that your opponents can  fully equip themselves with gear purchased for real money versus the  typical mundane means on PvE servers such as harvesting, tradeskilling  or the broker.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Picking_a__Side_">Picking a "Side"</h3>At  this time there no advantage besides your starting city when choosing a  "Side". If you prefer a certain race that is only available as Good or  Evil; you can always betray later on keeping both your class and race if  you'd like.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Picking_a_City">Picking a City</h3>Several  factors can come in to play when picking your starting city. You can go  for the better equipment that Timerous Deep offers. But, expect  frequent distractions while questing for those pieces of equipment.  Neriak has a lot of very linear and quite simple quest lines. But, the  loot drops aren't as great. And, again, Darklight Wood is a hub for  Nektulos and Commonlands making it another hot spot for low level and  busy PvP.<br />For a new player who wants to learn the ropes, quest in  relative peace and perhaps even find some PvP that is a little more  balanced; I'd suggest starting in either Freeport, Keletin or Qyenos.  These legacy cities are often overlooked by the veteran players who  choose to roll alts in the newer cities because they're currently the  new "hot spot".<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Picking_a_Class">Picking a Class</h3>Picking  a class is the same as picking a class on the PvE servers. There is no  "best" class that is going to beat all the others. If this were the  case, everyone would be playing it. And, if such an overpowered class  did exist, don't expect that it will stay that way for more than a game  update or two.<br />Pick a class you enjoy and learn your class. No  matter which class you choose, if all you do is smash hotbar buttons  without knowing what your abilities/spells do, you are rarely going to  walk away from fight without seeing the Revive screen first.<br />Create  3 or 4 new characters if possible. And, play each of the casually until  you find one or two that you enjoy the most. Remember that your  equipment, as a new player, will be limited for the first 20 or 30  levels. Don't be discouraged by your class choice because somebody with a  well funded alt has beaten you with superior equipment and  ability/spell upgrades.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="PvP_Zone_Level_Restrictions_&amp;_Immunity_Areas">PvP Zone Level Restrictions &amp; Immunity Areas</h3><b>Zone Level Restrictions</b><br /><ul><li>Tier 1 (Level 0-9): 4 levels</li><li>Tier 2 (Level 10-19): 4 levels</li><li>Tier 3 (Level 20-29): 8 levels</li><li>Tier 4 (Level 30-39): 8 levels</li><li>Tier 5 (Level 40-49): 10 levels</li><li>Tier 6 (Level 50-59): 10 levels</li><li>Tier 7 (Level 60-69): 10 levels</li><li>Tier 8 (Level 70-80): Unlimited</li></ul>Note:  These level restrictions only apply to the character or group of  greater level. For example, a Level 12 character can attack a character  of any level greater than them, regardless of the zone restrictions.  But, the opposite is not true except through some rumored and very  rarely used exploits.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Carnage_Flags">Carnage Flags</h3>Carnage  Flags typically apply to Cities. When you are visiting an enemy city  you are flagged. What this means is that you are attackable by anyone of  any level. So, in addition to avoiding the guards, you must avoid other  players too. Typically you'll see somebody carnage flagged when they  are betraying.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Exiles">Exiles</h3>Exile is  the phase during Betrayal in which you hold no loyalty to any city.  Some people choose to remain in Exile so that they can experience more  PvP. The reason being is that Exiles are attackble by both sides and  vice versa.<br /><h2 class="wheader" id="Equipment_&amp;_Abilities">Equipment &amp; Abilities</h2><h3 class="wheader" id="When_to_equip_for_PvP">When to equip for PvP</h3>When  to begin upgrading your equipment and abilities depends a lot on your  play style. For those looking for PvP in the earlier levels it will be  necessary to upgrade your equipment and abilities at every tier. If  leveling is more important, then it really isn't necessary to upgrade  your gear until you've hit the level 30 range where things slow down.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Acquiring_Equipment_&amp;_Abilities">Acquiring Equipment &amp; Abilities</h3>There  are three methods to acquiring your equipment. Player made Master  Crafted gear will serve you fine for the most part. Keep in mind that  there will be people better geared than you who will always have an  advantage. Non-Raid loot drops are usually of less quality than Master  Crafted. Until you are Raiding or doing high end group content, its not  advised that you PvP with loot dropped gear. PvP equipment is available  through the PvP City Task system. By completing tasks you collect tokens  as well as faction which allows you to purchase PvP gear.<br />Abilities  can be acquired through loot drops or made by players. Sages create  spells. Alchemists create Fighter abilities. And, Jewelers create rogue  abilities. Loot drops are typically Adept I or Master I. Player made  abilities are Adept III.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Upgrading_Equipment_&amp;_Abilities">Upgrading Equipment &amp; Abilities</h3>As  mentioned earlier. Your equipment should at least be Master Crafted.  Each piece (weapon, shield, armor, jewelry) will require a rare and  possibly material to imbue. Upgrading can be expensive if done in one  shot, so I recommend harvesting early on to avoid the cost of rares on  the broker.<br />Abilities should <b>always</b> be upgraded to at least  Adept III. As soon as you receive a new ability remember to upgrade it  asap else you face a very long and expensive laundry list of abilities  to upgrade all at once. If you have an expendable income, you can  purchase your Master I spells/abilities on the Broker. But, be prepared  for quite a bit of sticker shock as many Masters have an extremely low  drop rate and are usually distributed amongst raid members for their alt  characters to use.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="PvP_Writs/Tasks_&amp;_PvP_Gear">PvP Writs/Tasks &amp; PvP Gear</h3><i>Coming Soon</i><br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Importance_of_Tradeskills_&amp;_Harvesting">Importance of Tradeskills &amp; Harvesting</h3>The  importance of tradeskills and harvesting is a simple matter of time vs.  money. Most new players who do not already have an existing established  and wealthy character on the same server are forced with deciding  whether to run about under equipped or putting the time in to harvesting  and working the tradeskills to supply their character's equipment and  ability/spell needs.<br />Its recommended that you level your  tradeskills at the same pace or faster than your adventure level so that  you are not playing catch up when you're adventure level surpasses your  tradeskill level. Ideally you want your tradeskill level to be at least  10 levels higher so that they can make the full spectrum of recipes  necessary to upgrade the character.<br />The other option, which is not  quite as time consuming, is to begin harvesting right away and always  be harvesting the zones that are one tier above your current adventure  level tier. This strategy provides you with the rares you'll need ahead  of time when you are ready to upgrade your gear.<br />Finally, if you  are in an active established guild, you will probably have members of  every tradeskill in your ranks. This is helpful because many people will  not charge or charge no more than the cost of fuel for producing  upgrades for their guild mates.<br /><h2 class="wheader" id="Achievement_Awards_(AA)">Achievement Awards (AA)</h2>AA  points are spell/ability/stats boosts to your existing abilities, etc.  Picking an AA tree is very important in PvP because choosing the wrong  AA path could essentially cripple your character with buffed up  abilities that do not compliment the character. Check your class forums  for tips on recommended AA paths for your class.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Importance_of_AA_in_PvP">Importance of AA in PvP</h3>AA  points can easily determine whether you lose or win a fight against an  evenly or even lesser geared enemy. Rarely are you going to win a fight  with somebody who hits harder with massive crits, heals faster, or runs  faster. Unlike a PvE server, where natural accumulation of AA points is  acceptable; PvP requires that you try to max out your AA points (1.5 x  Level) as best you can. Fighting on a PvP server with less than suitable  gear, abilities and AA points is the equivalent to fighting wearing a  paper bag and wielding a plastic straw.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Common_methods_for_maximum_AA_each_level">Common methods for maximum AA each level</h3>Exploring  new areas aka Points of Interest (POI) and harvesting shinies and  completing collection quests is the most popular method of increasing  AA. Completing quests is a slower method and will in no way max out your  AA trees by itself. For every new character I create, I travel to every  area of the game I can often dying to mobs simply to get a free  Revive-Ride to somewhere I am unable to reach on foot. Once I've covered  all the areas I can get to myself, I usually have a guild mate or  friend that has a T8 character "escort" me to the unreachable areas or  tag a long on raids that are within 10 levels of my adventure level in  order to pick up the AA from Named Mobs.<br />Note: You do not receive  AA points until you reach Level 10. So, from level 1-9, try to stick to  one area to level up. At level 10, visit all the other T1 areas you  haven't visited before moving on the T2 content. If you get a quest that  sends you to an area you haven't been before prior to level 10, save it  in your quest journal until you have achieved level 10 even if the  quest goes gray for you in the meantime. The AA experience is much more  valuable to you than the quest level, cash or useless drops you might  receive.<br /><h2 class="wheader" id="Combat_&amp;_Survival_Tips">Combat &amp; Survival Tips</h2><h3 class="wheader" id="Recent_Kill_List">Recent Kill List</h3>The  Recent Kill List (RKL) is a game mechanic which keeps tracks of who  you've killed or has killed you for 30 minutes. During this time 30  minutes you will receive no reward for killing somebody on your RKL. Nor  will they receive any reward if they kill you and you are currently on  their RKL.<br />This does <b>not</b> make you immune nor does it mean  that somebody won't attack you again for strategic reasons such as  keeping you from rejoining a group fight. And, some people simply enjoy  the fight and are more than happy to fight you over and over again for  the fun of it. Also, if you are attacked by a group, they may return to  your revive point so that other members of the group can get updates for  their writs. <br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Group_vs._Solo">Group vs. Solo</h3><b>Solo:</b><br />While  a very viable play style, the player who solos needs to keep one thing  in mind. Groups are going to roll you, and do so frequently.<br />Best  class type for the solo PvP is one of the Rogues. One who solos PvP is  going to need to be a predator and the tracking skill is the best tool  available. Not only does tracking let you find your prey before they  know you're there, but it allows you to avoid groups.<br />One mistake  that new rogues make is that they remain stealthed under the impression  that nobody can see them. First of all, Stealth cancels all speed  bonuses. Secondly, <b>everybody</b> can see you. The only advantage  Stealth grants to a rogue is the ability to avoid mobs and NPC's. This  is useful when approaching a target who is beyond or surrounded by an  aggro mob. Its also an excellent escape tactic by running in to an aggro  mob after hitting stealth. The mob will hopefully target your pursuer  and give you an opportunity to escape.<br />Another good class type to  solo PvP is one of the Priest classes. Preferably one with DPS. I prefer  the Fury personally. The healers can usually handle 2-3 attackers if  they manage their power pool well with constant healing and distributing  of DPS &amp; Roots.<br /><b>Group:</b><br />Personal class choice is  irrelevant here. But, when choosing your group members its always good  to have 1-2 healers present in case you encounter another group. A Rogue  in the group will give you the advantage of finding targets easier in a  zone with their Tracking and the buffs (Dirge, Troubadour) help as  well. Pet classes can be handy for positioning a target strategically  for the rogues (Brigand, Assassin) to get their most powerful blows in.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Running/Escaping/Suicide">Running/Escaping/Suicide</h3>Contrary to some people, running away is a very solid tactic. When you  lose a fight, somebody is gaining something. A portion of the coin in  your purse, a random item or more importantly a PvP Writ update. Deny  them that satisfaction by getting away! <br /><b>Running Away:</b><br />In  order to run away and survive you're going to use several tactics. The  First is the environment. They can't target or land an attack if they  don't have line of sight. Run behind rocks, trees and into mobs. Second,  Make sure you're buffed up on speed including sprinting. It may drain  your power, but you're running for your life so who cares? If they can  outrun you your effort is futile. Get to a Zone point if possible. Most  people camping a zone will turn around as soon as you Zone out. Not  always, but its a last ditch effort to deprive them of a Writ Update.<br /><b>Escaping:</b><br />This  is a Rogue ability gained at T4 that allows you to escape to the  nearest revive point and avoid a fight. Note that if you initiate an  attack and are unable to break combat you will not be able to use this  ability. This is ideal for avoiding groups that surprise you or you see  ahead of time on your tracking window. In a group, it will evacuate the  entire group to the nearest revive point unless a member of your group  initiated the attack.<br />There are various items that also allow for escape/evacuate by non-Rogue classes via Quest rewards and LoN.<br /><b>Suicide:</b><br />Suicide  was made popular during the introduction of Kingdom of the Sky. Then it  was referred to as "Cloud Jumping". Primarily a form of  self-preservation for those who had gained a PvP Title and didn't wish  to lose it. So, jumping to their death kept their title in place as  there was no fame loss from dying to "natural causes" so to speak.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Immunity">Immunity</h3>There  are several forms of Immunity in PvP. The 30 seconds of immunity when  you zone in to a zone or out of a city or instance. There is Revive  Immunity which is permanent unless you leave the Revive Point. And  finally area immunity. This is a designated in a zone such as a dock  where you are immune until you leave the designated area. Outside the  Area of Immunity, you receive the 30 minute countdown timer until you  are no longer immune. Note: Re-entering an Area of Immunity will reset  the timer and it will be 30 seconds until you once again Immune. Many  new players make the mistake that if they run in to an Area of Immunity  they will immediately be safe from attack.<br /><b>Exploits:</b><br />At  the time that this guide was published, there are several known  exploits in the game which allow players to attack and kill somebody in  Immunity. Standing in Immunity, unless in a city, does not guarantee  that somebody won't kill you. When this happens, you can target the  player that attacked you and /report the player. Be sure to have your  chat log displaying that you were both attacked and in Immunity.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Looting_&amp;_Banking">Looting &amp; Banking</h3><b>Looting:</b><br />Looting  another player is an automatic process when you kill them. You may  receive one random non-attuned/equipped item from your victims backpack.  And, if the player is carrying any coin you will receive between 20-50%  of their coin.<br /><b>Banking:</b><br />Unlike the PvE servers,  where one can carry their entire wealth on their persons without fear of  losing a single coin; On the PvP servers it is very important to bank  before you leave a city. When leaving an instance it is important to get  back to a city ASAP and bank your rewards. Instances are often camped  by groups of players because those leaving are typically carrying a  substantial amount of coin and rares.<br /><h2 class="wheader" id="Fame_&amp;_Titles">Fame &amp; Titles</h2><i>Coming Soon. Awaiting input on the exact numbers which constitute the current fame system mechanics.</i><br /><h3 class="wheader" id="What_is_Fame">What is Fame</h3>With  each successful Kill or Death, you either gain or lose Fame  (Reputation). As your Fame increases you will eventually gain a Title.  If you lose a fight to somebody, you lose Fame and possibly your current  Title.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Titles_&amp;_How_to_Get_a_Title">Titles &amp; How to Get a Title</h3>After  a recent update it is uncertain exactly how the Fame/Title system works  at the moment. You still gain fame by killing other players with  Titles. But, by dying you will no longer lose Fame it seems. So, once  you achieve a Title you keep it forever as long as you are actively  participating in PvP.<br /><h3 class="wheader" id="Fame_Decay">Fame Decay</h3>Fame  Decay is a recent addition to the game to encourage people to PvP more  frequently. As long as you are logged in to the game, you will not lose  any Fame. However, you will lose Fame if you log out of the game. The  longer you are logged out, the more Fame you will lose.<br />However, since the recent changes, you will not lose Fame if you die in a PvP fight.
